is whistling at someone in the street really a crime? what a waste of time’. but we’ve had 447 fines already and when the law is better known there will be more.” it may not be simple to catch someone persistently harassing in the street or the bus  but masson believes the law is a serious deterrent. “a fine of up to €350 will make people think again about their behaviour ” masson says. “the fact that it’s an offence and there’s a fine to be paid at once can be very dissuasive. schiappa told mps in april: “many of you on these benches told us it would never work  that we would not be able to define offensive sexist behaviour. the figures showed the government action was efficient and would grow in its power. with this law  france has become the first country in the world to punish harassment in the streets with fines.”", "moi aussi?

(he denies any wrongdoing  labelling the accusations a “witch-hunt”.) by this weekend “king bibi”  as his most ardent supporters like to call him  had fully expected to preside over a government preparing to pass a bill granting a sitting prime minister immunity from prosecution. it was in return for this that he had  before the election  held out to his ultra-nationalist  would-be coalition partners the seismic prospect of annexing at least parts of the occupied west bank. and to satisfy them further  he was ready to promote unprecedented curbs on israel’s supreme court. unfortunately  netanyahu reckoned without avigdor lieberman. having emerged as kingmaker  the ambitious moldova-born former foreign and defence minister  who was once a close lieutenant of netanyahu  decided not to bring his five knesset members into what would have then become a right-wing majority government. the sole point at issue was a draft law to end the wholesale exemption of ultra-orthodox men from military conscription – now likely to be a key issue in the next election. lieberman refused to compromise on the law with the ultra-orthodox parties  another crucial element of netanyahu’s putative rightwing coalition. while lieberman may pick up new votes beyond his mainly russian-speaking constituency – both for standing up to netanyahu and for posturing as the champion of secular israel – he is  to put it mildly  no liberal. a super-hawk who has demanded the death penalty for terrorists  he called for arabs living in israel to lose their citizenship unless they declare formal allegiance to the state. and he resigned from the cabinet last year  protesting netanyahu’s failure to enact even harsher military measures against gaza. but his sabotaging of the coalition process has not only severely weakened netanyahu but also cast fresh doubt on the trump administration’s faltering plans for a “deal of the century” to solve the israeli-palestinian conflict. after the spectacularly ill-timed visit of trump’s son-in-law jared kushner and middle east adviser jason greenblatt for talks last week with netanyahu to bolster this month’s bahrain conference on economic aspects of the plan  us officials insisted the conference  which the palestinians boycotted  would go ahead. however  it is still unclear whether or when the administration intends to unveil the political aspects of the plan  which had been delayed to await formation of a stable israeli government  and was satirised on thursday as the “deal of the next century” by palestinian liberation organisation negotiator saeb erekat. despite his attempts to make light of it  the collapse of the coalition negotiations is a severe personal blow to netanyahu. even if the parliamentary arithmetic had allowed him to form a government without lieberman  his chances of escaping prosecution have shrunk. the election is fixed for 17 september  just a month before he is due to face a pre-indictment hearing  leaving little or no time to introduce an immunity bill if and when he forms a government with no doubt increasingly reluctant coalition partners. he could also face an internal revolt from impatient likud rivals. it remains to be seen whether lieberman again emerges as a kingmaker  but it looks increasingly likely that netanyahu’s one-time ally will go down in history as the king-breaker.", "how israel’s ‘kingmaker’ could be the man to end bibi’s reign | donald macintyre", "2019-06-01t13:41:44z", "benjamin netanyahu";"israel";"world news";"middle east and north africa"

streep then announced that “we hurt our boys by calling something toxic masculinity. women can be pretty fucking toxic … it’s toxic people. “we have our good angles and we have our bad ones ” streep continued. “i think the labels are less helpful than what we’re trying to get to  which is a communication  direct  between human beings. we’re all on the boat together. we’ve got to make it work.” (excuse me  can someone stop the boat for a moment please? i just need a second while my eyes stop rolling.) seriously  meryl? seriously? i don’t want to label streep’s comments “ridiculous”  because labels are less helpful than what i’m trying to get to  which is the fact streep clearly has no idea what “toxic masculinity” means. i shouldn’t have to say this  it should be obvious  but “toxic masculinity” doesn’t mean that men are toxic or that masculinity is de facto toxic. rather  it means that extreme forms of traits traditionally associated with masculinity  like aggression and stoicism  are toxic. rightwingers  however  like to pretend the phrase is an attack on men because it’s a quick way of derailing a conversation about rigid gender norms  and allows them to pretend that feminism is some sort of plot against men. indeed conservative outlets like fox news are already having a field day with streep’s comments. we don’t “hurt our boys” by labelling certain behavior “toxic masculinity”. we hurt our boys when we teach them that being a man means suppressing your emotions and treating women as an inferior species  to be dominated and controlled. and toxic masculinity doesn’t just hurt men  it kills them. in america  for example  men are 3.5 times more likely to die from suicide than women – a phenomenon many experts attribute  in part  to the fact that men are told they shouldn’t express emotion or admit that they feel vulnerable  and therefore are less likely to seek professional help. it’s also well established that toxic masculinity kills women. women are far more likely than men to die at the hands of their partner  to cite just one example. as a 2018 united nations global study on homicide notes  “intimate partner violence against women and girls is rooted in widely-accepted gender norms about men’s authority …and men’s use of violence to exert control over women. research shows that men and boys who adhere to rigid views of gender roles and masculinity … are more likely to use violence against a partner.” streep is right that women can also be “pretty fucking toxic”. but  again  she misses the point completely; the issue isn’t individual women but rigid social norms associated with femininity. being told that being a woman means being pretty and pure is toxic. being told that your worth as a woman rests on getting married and having kids is toxic. being taught to cry and play the damsel in distress to avoid accountability is toxic. being taught to treat other women as sexual rivals is toxic. here’s the big difference between toxic masculinity and toxic femininity  however: the latter is a lot less deadly  a lot less dangerous. the difference between toxic masculinity and toxic femininity is that the president of the united states is not a woman who has boasted about grabbing men by their genitals  and dismissed this as “locker room talk”. the difference is that there aren’t two female supreme court justices who have been accused of sexual misconduct. the difference is that a group of powerful women are not currently passing legislation preventing american men having control over their own bodies. the fact that streep can talk about how “toxic masculinity”  as a phrase  harms boys at a time when american women are currently facing a full-on assault of their reproductive rights is mind-boggling. the fact that she can blithely say that “we’re all on the boat together” when republicans have made it very clear they’re steering the boat towards gilead  is infuriating. but at least she stopped her lecture on civility there  i suppose. we can  at least  be grateful that she didn’t go on to inform us that all lives matter  and we shouldn’t focus on labels or race because we’re all africans really. women’s fertility app funded by anti-abortion campaigners a guardian investigation has found that the femm app  which helps women keep track of their menstrual cycle  received large amounts of funding from anti-abortion catholic campaigners. the guardian also notes that the “femm app’s literature sows doubt about the safety and efficacy of hormonal birth control  asserting that it may be deleterious to a woman’s health and that a safer  ‘natural’ way for women to avoid pregnancy is to learn their cycles.” it’s the latest disturbing reminder that female-focused health apps don’t always serve your best interests. america’s war against abortion continues on thursday louisiana became the latest state to pass a strict new abortion ban. south africa’s historic gender-balanced cabinet for the first time in south africa’s history half of all cabinet posts are now held by women. leonardo dicreepio’s gross dating habits someone on reddit made a graph showing leonardo dicaprio (44) refuses to date a woman over 25. since 1999 the average age of his girlfriends has been 22.9 years. the french men’s soccer team needs a talking to the women’s world cup is around the corner  which is something of a big deal. that hasn’t stopped the french men’s football team from kicking the women’s squad out of the national training camp  just days before the competition gets under way. nice one  lads. accidental sky penis the us air force has a history of using their fighter jets to draw phallic images in the sky during training exercises. the latest incident was on tuesday but air force officials have insisted “there was no nefarious or inappropriate behavior during the training flight”. rest assured it was simply a cock-up. in the us  the suicide prevention lifeline is 1-800-273-8255 and the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-safe (7233). other international helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org. in the uk and ireland  samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is 0808 2000 247. in australia  the crisis support service lifeline is 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is 1800 737 732.", "seriously  meryl streep?

has ended another busy session  sending bills to the governor that would ban red-light traffic cameras  end regulation of the plumbing industry  make it easier to dine outdoors with a dog  carry brass knuckles  and possess a gun inside a rented apartment and a place of worship. but as usual  politicians did not manage to repeal a homophobic law that has been unenforceable since 2003  meaning that a ban on “homosexual conduct” remains part of the texas penal code. this states that it is a class c misdemeanor offense  punishable with up to a $500 fine  if a person “engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex”. it is 16 years since the us supreme court struck down texas’s anti-sodomy law. the case  lawrence v texas  arose after sheriff’s deputies charged two men with a misdemeanor for having sex in a houston-area apartment in 1998. yet texas’s biennial legislature recently concluded its 2019 session without passing any of seven democrat-led bills that would have excised the “homosexual conduct” prohibition  which was enacted in 1973. it would not be complex or time-consuming to strike out a brief section from the code  and democrats have tried at every regular session since the supreme court ruling. none of this year’s bills made it beyond the committee stage. attempts to update the texas family code to comply with the 2015 supreme court decision that legalised same-sex marriage nationwide also went nowhere. the code insists  in language introduced in 2003: “a marriage between persons of the same sex or a civil union is contrary to the public policy of this state and is void in this state.” texas is “by definition an anti-homosexual state”  said garnet coleman  a democratic state representative from harris county who has filed a bill to repeal the “homosexual conduct” ban in each of the past eight regular sessions. another of his proposals  to simplify the process of gender changes on official documents  was also spurned this year. “it’s sort of a given ” he said. “the anti-lgbtq sentiments in the republican party are so strong that even an evidence-based circumstance can’t be voted for.” republicans on the texas house criminal jurisprudence committee did not respond to requests for comment. the 2003 ruling invalidated similar bans in other states  but texas is not alone in its reticence to delete unconstitutional laws. utah repealed its bar of sodomy (and adultery) in march  joining montana and virginia  which repealed laws in 2013 and 2014 respectively. but anti-sodomy laws technically remain in alabama  florida  georgia  idaho  kansas  kentucky  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  mississippi  north carolina  oklahoma and south carolina  as well as texas. some mention anal or oral sex in the same breath as bestiality  such as michigan  where the penal code declares: “any person who shall commit the abominable and detestable crime against nature either with mankind or with any animal shall be guilty of a felony.” according to louisiana law  the attorney general has the power to institute civil proceedings against businesses that engage in “unlawful activity aimed at organized homosexuality”. the law cites homosexuality in the same sentence as prostitution  narcotics  extortion and embezzlement. critics of the laws argue they are not merely archaic and irrelevant quirks but reflections of current discriminatory attitudes that send a hostile message to lgbt people and occasionally have a direct impact. a police officer in el paso  for example  threatened to arrest a group of gay men for violating texas’s homosexual conduct law after two kissed in a restaurant in 2009. an investigation by the advocate in 2013 found that a sheriff’s office in baton rouge  louisiana  had arrested at least a dozen gay men using an invalid sodomy law. that prompted an apology from the sheriff  but two men having sex in a car were arrested for “crimes against nature” in the same city in 2015. florida’s prohibition of “unnatural and lascivious acts” has led to gay men being arrested for consensual sexual activity. and outmoded american statutes were cited by the russian president  vladimir putin  to defend his own country’s anti-gay law in 2014. in a texas legislature dominated by conservatives  changing or making laws requires republican support. but gay rights advocates are forced to devote much of their energy to stopping lawmakers from passing new anti-lgbt bills. one group  equality texas  said its lobbying helped kill 19 bills in this year’s session. the texas republican party’s platform stated until 2014 that “the practice of homosexuality tears at the fabric of society and contributes to the breakdown of the family unit”. its current manifesto still opposes same-sex marriage and says “homosexual behavior” is against “god’s biblical design”. “the party’s elected officeholders are terrified of doing anything that would anger the most extreme anti-lgbtq activists and pressure groups who remain so influential in their party ” said dan quinn of the texas freedom network  a progressive advocacy group. “while national public opinion has shifted substantially in support of treating lgbtq americans and their families equally under the law  too many texas republicans continue to see opposition to that as almost a litmus test for conservatives.” republicans who do anything that could be construed as supportive of lgbt issues fear being challenged by far-right voters in primary elections  said mary gonzález  a democratic state representative from el paso who identifies as pansexual and is the chair of the texas house’s recently formed lgbtq caucus. but she is optimistic that attitudes are changing. “i think what this session taught me is to be much more optimistic when it comes to lgbt justice and advances than in the past. granted  while we didn’t get anything across the finish line you could see the shift ” she said. “six years ago i was the only [out lgbt female legislator in texas] and it was a big deal and people were just really uncomfortable with it. now there’s five-plus openly out allies  it’s just

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/31/missouri-abortion-clinic-closure-threat-granite-city-illinois-influx", "eric lutz", "dr erin king felt a weight lift off her shoulders – at least for a few minutes. the executive director of hope clinic in granite city  illinois had spent a week “scrambling” to prepare for an influx of patients from st louis – just about a 10 minute drive across the mississippi river – as missouri threatened to close its last legal abortion provider by the end of the week at midnight. in a ruling friday afternoon  circuit judge michael stelzer issued a temporary restraining order keeping missouri from allowing the st louis planned parenthood’s license to expire – keeping the clinic in operation at least until tuesday. it didn’t remove the stress for king  but it at least allowed her  her staff  and planned parenthood officials in missouri a few more days to prepare for the worst. “it does not give me comfort ” king said of the ruling friday afternoon. “but it is good news for the very short term.” abortion rights in missouri have been under “aggressive” attack for more than two years now. but earlier this month  the republican governor mike parson signed a restrictive bill prohibiting the procedure after eight weeks and even criminalizing doctors who perform it. the state has also been using administrative maneuvering to stamp out abortion here  women’s rights advocates say. the department of health and senior services is declining to renew the st louis clinic’s license unless it grants the state interviews with all seven physicians who practice at the clinic  including trainees – something planned parenthood has described as “harassment” and an excuse to roll back reproductive rights. if the st louis planned parenthood were to be closed for the procedure  missouri would become the first state in the country in close to 50 years without a legal abortion provider. that would force clinics like king’s  in neighboring states near the missouri border  to pick up the slack. illinois has passed legislation to expand abortion access – a move cheered by king  who finds herself straddling two different worlds. “we’re sitting literally on this cusp of what could potentially be one of the worst days for abortion rights in this region  and one of the best – separated by a river ” king said. anticipating attacks on abortion rights  the hope clinic has already doubled the number of its doctors  increased its staff  and added additional appointment days to its schedule to accommodate the influx in patients. but the latest wave of threats against reproductive rights has been “scary” – and put both staff and patients on edge  king said in an interview. “we’ve seen a significant increase in patient stress in the last two weeks ” king said in her office. “it is very clear there is a lot of anxiety. a lot of tension.” hope clinic is located near a large healthcare campus on the ragged edge of this manufacturing town. on the sidewalk leading up to its door  protesters have scribbled out anti-abortion messages in chalk. “god knit you in your mother’s womb ” one square of sidewalk read friday morning. “abortion scars uterus + weakens cervix ” read another. inside the busy clinic  king has fostered a calming presence. she comes off as upbeat  even on a day like friday  when her home state – she lives across the river in st louis with her husband  dr david eisenberg  the co-medical director of planned parenthood of the st louis region – was hours away from losing its last abortion clinic. she’s good at brushing off the anti-abortion demonstrators who gather outside the clinic on a near daily basis. she’s good at focusing on the positive feedback the clinic gets from patients  some of which is posted on a cork board outside her office: “thanks for all you do on a daily basis ” reads one message from a former patient. still  even king is exasperated by republican attacks on reproductive rights – so much so that she has  at times  considered leaving missouri. “i feel like i am dehumanized ” she said. “we’re going backwards in time.” ultimately  judge stelzer granted the st louis planned parenthood a temporary stay in what eisenberg said in a press conference outside the clinic friday was a “huge victory” for missourians. a massive banner on the clinic read: “still here.” for abortion rights supporters outside the clinic friday  the judge’s ruling was merely temporary “breathing room” – and provided little relief. “the fight’s not over ” said peg o’malley  who stood outside the clinic holding a sign reading: “pro-choice catholic.” “it’s just unbelievable ” another planned parenthood supporter  kathy turner  said outside the embattled clinic. she was there with her husband and small child to show her support. “i never thought it would get this bad.” it’s not clear what will ultimately happen to the clinic. stelzer ruled friday that “immediate and irreparable injury will result if petitioner’s license is allowed to expire”  allowing the clinic to continue providing abortions past midnight friday  when its license was due to expire. but it’s not yet clear what its fate will be past tuesday  when another hearing is scheduled. even if it is allowed to continue operating  though  reproductive rights in missouri are in peril – with only one abortion clinic for a state with a population of more than 3 million women and reproductive rights under threat from republicans in the state legislature. “this is a crisis ” king said. “this is happening.”", "threat to missouri

bid for the tory leadership. the sun described the remarks as a “bombshell intervention” in the leadership contest and “major breach of protocol”. trump’s actual quotes do not approach an actual endorsement  however. after the reporter twice referred to johnson as “prime minster boris johnson”  trump responded with general praise  saying: “i think boris would do a very good job. i think he

missouri’s only abortion clinic to remain open: “today is a victory for women across missouri  but this fight is far from over. we have seen just how vulnerable access to abortion care is here—and in the rest of the country. we are glad that the governor has been prevented from putting women’s health and lives in danger—for now—and call on him to stop this egregious politicalization of public health in an attempt to ban all safe  legal abortion care in the state. “we want our patients to know that we will never abandon the women of missouri. we will keep fighting these attempts to end access to health care  to ensure all people can get the care that they need—no matter what.” dr. colleen mcnichola  an abortion provider at planned parenthood of the st. louis region  said: “this is a huge sigh of relief for the many patients who need access to safe  legal abortion in missouri. the fight goes on. while temporary  we celebrate today  and tomorrow we go back to work to ensure access to abortion does not go dark at the last health center that provides abortion in missouri. planned parenthood has served missouri for more than 87 years and we aren’t going anywhere. while governor

breathing room.” she and her friend  mary kuc  had stood on a corner near the planned parenthood  where supporters of the healthcare organization and anti-abortion activists gathered ahead of the

restraining order blocking the state’s effort to shut them down. missouri’s last remaining abortion provider – a planned parenthood in st louis - was threatened with losing its license after the state charged it did not comply with a health department investigation. it would have been the only state without a single abortion clinic. but the judge ruled that the clinic demonstrated that “immediate and irreparable injury will result if petitioner’s license is allowed to expire ” so it must be allowed to remain open while the merits of the case are argued. another hearing was set for tuesday. fox news is defending host laura ingraham after her comments calling white supremacist paul nehlen a “prominent voice” on the right who was “censored by social media.” “it is obscene to suggest that laura

facebook ” the network said in a statement to the daily beast. “anyone who watches laura’s show knows that she is a fierce protector of freedom of speech and the intent of the segment was to highlight the growing trend of unilateral censorship in america.” california governor gavin newsom is encouraging women seeking abortions to come to his state if their own states restrict the procedure. “california will continue to uphold women’s equality and liberty by protecting their reproductive freedom  educating californians about their rights to reproductive freedom  welcoming women to

sacramento bee reports. newsom and the governors of oregon and washington also sent a letter friday to other governors urging them to pursue laws strengthening abortion rights in their states. donald trump’s top trade adviser opposed his push to put tariffs on mexico  the wall street journal reports. trade representative robert lighthizer argued internally that the tariffs would jeopardize a

overall oppose it 54% to 31%. an 81% majority of democrats and a 68% majority of americans overall support voting rights for felons after they have completed their full sentences. senator bernie sanders has pushed allowing felons to vote from prison. as the last abortion clinic in missouri is threatened with closure  providers in nearby states are rushing to pick up the slack. dr erin king  the executive director of hope clinic  the nearest abortion provider across the river in granite city  ill.  is “scrambling” to prepare for an influx of patients seeking the procedure should st louis planned parenthood’s license be revoked. she says she’s been preparing for a couple years now as the missouri government ramped up its war on reproductive rights  doubling its number of doctors and increasing its staff. but  she told the guardian  the immediacy of the missouri nearing the loss of its last abortion provider is forcing her and her staff to adapt quickly. what’s going on in missouri is “very scary ” king said. while she says the crisis won’t impact the level of care at her clinic  located about a 10 minute drive from downtown st louis  it has put both her staff and her patients on edge. “we’ve seen a significant increase in patient stress in the last two weeks ” she said  referring to the department of health and senior services challenge to planned parenthood and the restrictive abortion bill republican governor mike parson signed into law this month. on the heels of protests in st louis  missouri yesterday  as the state’s last abortion clinic could close  planned parenthood’s president dr leana wen told the guardian women’s healthcare is in a “state of emergency” in the united states. “this is a terrifying time ” wen said. “we have a situation not unlike a natural disaster  where people’s lives are in danger. except this is manmade.” abortion is legal in all 50 us states  but that has not always meant it is accessible. missouri’s last abortion clinic is in danger of being shutdown because of bureaucratic red tape. missouri governor mike parson  who signed an eight-week abortion ban into law just last week  has argued the state health department found “deficient practices” at the health clinic. the health department is demanding interviews with all seven physicians practicing at the clinic  including trainees. planned parenthood  which already agreed to perform an addition medically unnecessary pelvic exam on its patients before an abortion (the state now requires two before the procedure) has called the demand “harassment” and intimidation of providers. “missouri’s governor just signed a law that could put doctors in jail for up to 15 years  could allow the state to investigate women for having miscarriages ” said wen. “so  there should be no confusion about what the true intention of the missouri governor really is – which is to stop all safe legal abortion in missouri.” wen also said people should not confuse the wave of new and extreme legislation with a groundswell against abortion rights. “this is what is happening across the country – there are extreme politicians who are passing the most egregious law we’ve ever seen – attacking women’s health ” she said. two-thirds of americans support roe v wade  the landmark 1973 us supreme court decision which legalized abortion  and which continues to make unconstitutional abortion bans  like missouri’s  unenforceable today. the american people  said wen  “are seeing what we have seen all along – this threat to roe v wade is not hypothetical. it is not a drill. this is really happening ” she said. “the american people know we need more healthcare  not less  we want our children to grow up in a world with more rights  not less. we will be organizing  educating  mobilizing all across the country.” the department of homeland security’s inspector general found “dangerous overcrowding” and unsanitary conditions at an el paso  texas  border patrol processing facility  cnn reports. the inspector general did an unannounced inspection of the el paso del norte processing center and found 750 and 900 migrants there on two separate days – far exceeding its capacity of 125. there were “standing room only conditions ” according to a report obtained by cnn  and customs and border protection “was struggling to maintain hygienic conditions in the holding cells” with many migrants wearing soiled clothes for days or weeks. there were 76 detainees packed into one cell that’s supposed to hold no more than 12  and 155 in a cell for 35. donald trump’s proposed tariffs on mexico will hit particularly hard in some states expected to be key 2020 election battlegrounds  cnbc reports: several key 2020 electoral states would take a particularly sharp blow from the tariffs. border state arizona gets about 40% of its imports from mexico  the highest share for any state. about 38% of michigan’s imported products come from mexico  while about 35% of texas’ imports are from its southern neighbor. trump’s surprise tariffs on mexican goods could raise costs for companies and consumers in those three states  which the president carried in the 2016 election. michigan is a swing state that had voted for barack obama in 2008 and 2012. texas is a reliably red state  but nonetheless has several republican lawmakers facing tough reelection campaigns next year. arizona has been trending toward favoring democrats. former ohio governor john kasich says he’s not planning a 2020 primary challenge to donald trump. “there is no path right now for me  i don’t see a way to get there ” kasich said friday on cnn  per the hill. “ninety percent of the republican party supports him ” he said. “maybe somebody wants to run and make a statement and that’s fine  but i’ve never gotten involved in a political race where i didn’t think i could win.” former massachusetts governor bill weld has launched a long-shot primary campaign against trump. white house press secretary sarah sanders said the white house is monitoring reports that north korea executed members of its nuclear negotiating team with the american government  including pyongyang’s top special envoy to the us. “i’m not going to comment on intelligence one way or another ” she said friday. “i can tell you we’re monitoring the situation and continue to stay focused on our ultimate goal  which is denuclearization.” white house press secretary sarah sanders on friday defended donald trump’s plan to impose new tariffs on mexican imports  telling reporters anyone surprised by the president’s announcement “has been living under a rock”. “we have been talking to mexico for months  asking them to step up and do more ” sanders said  referring to what the trump administration’s frustration with the flow of central american migrants through the us-mexico border. sanders added that while trump had not spoken directly with mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador  who threatened retaliatory tariffs against the us  teams for both leaders have been in “regular communication”. “the president is concerned about national security ” sanders said. trump’s move to slap a 5% tariff on all mexican imports rattled markets and invited criticism from some members of his own party  who accused the president of overstepping his trade authorities. “the president didn’t blindside his own party ” sanders said. “this is fully supported by the law.” house judiciary committee chairman jerry nadler says he believes donald trump’s campaign did collude with russia  and that trump would have been indicted if he wasn’t president  crain’s new york reports. new york city’s police union  a longtime foe of mayor bill de blasio  is warning south carolina police about de blasio as he arrives for a campaign stop there. “as you can see  a president bill de blasio would be an unmitigated disaster  not just for union members  but for any american who wants a functioning government ” patrolmen’s benevolent association president patrick lynch wrote in a letter to the s.c. law enforcement officers association  the state reports. the pba is locked in a contract fight with de blasio and has protested him as he runs for president. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is not taking a firm position on donald trump’s threatened tariffs against mexico  per the washington post. donald trump argues that his mexican tariff plan will cause companies to leave mexico and return to the us. mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador said friday that he has sent his foreign secretary to washington to try to negotiate a solution after donald trump announced 5% tariffs on the country’s goods  npr reports. a federal appeals court has agreed to expedite donald trump’s appeal of a ruling allowing a bank to hand over his financial records to the house of representatives. the second circuit court of appeals on friday granted the request to fast track the case  the hill reports. trump is appealing a ruling by a judge last week who declined to block deutsche bank and capital one from handing over records in response to a subpoena from house democrats. only 11 employers were prosecuted for hiring undocumented immigrants in the year that ended in march  the new york times reports. the data suggests the trump administration has not made going after employers a priority  even as it pursues hard-line policies on immigration. during the same 12-month period  more than 112000 individuals were prosecuted for illegal entry or re-entry into the us  according to data obtained under the freedom of information act by the transactional records access clearinghouse at syracuse university. “not only are few employers prosecuted  fewer who are convicted receive sentences that amount to more than token punishment ” trac told the times. donald trump’s golf courses have been caught employing unauthorized immigrants  many of whom have since been fired  but never faced any legal consequences. donald trump is defending his plan for tariffs on mexican goods. patrick shanahan  the acting defense secretary  insisted friday that the military would remain apolitical  after news emerged that the uss john mccain was hidden from donald trump’s sight during a trip to japan. “our business is to run military operations and not to become politicized ” shanahan said in singapore  cnn reports. “i’ll wait until i get a full explanation of the facts before i pass judgment on the situation  but our job is to run the military.” us stock futures and global stock markets tanked friday after donald trump announced plans for a 5% tariff on mexican imports. cnn reports on the damage: japan’s nikkei (n225) slumped 1.6%  while south korea’s kospi (kospi) was mostly flat. markets in europe also opened lower. britain’s ftse 100 index fell 0.8%. stocks in germany shed 1.3%  and in francethey dipped 1%. stock futures indicated that those losses would extend to the united states. the dow is poised to fall 230 points  or 0.9%  when markets open. the s&amp;p 500 is tracking similar losses  while the nasdaq could drop 1.1%. washington governor and presidential candidate jay inslee released an immigration plan friday that calls for a large increase in refugees admitted to the us. inslee has centered his democratic primary bid on climate change  and this is his first major police proposal on another issue. cnn reports that it calls for letting at least 110000 refugees into the country each year. donald trump has capped the number at 30000. he also proposes addressing “climate migration ” and increasing aid to guatemala  honduras and el salvador to help those countries tackle the problems  climate-related and otherwise  that have caused a flood of migrants to leave for the us. world leaders will gather in solemn assembly next week above the sandy beaches of normandy to mark the 75th anniversary of the world-changing d-day invasion of france. it’s typically a heartfelt tribute to alliance and sacrifice and a unified vow for enduring unity  outweighing any national or political skirmish of the moment - but donald trump could change all that  the associated press reports: that’s what has some u.s. veterans and others worried about president donald trump’s attendance. the president has shown a repeated willingness to inject nationalistic rhetoric and political partisanship into moments once aimed at unity. for trump  there is no water’s edge for politics  no veneer of nonpartisanship around military or national security matters. the president  who did not serve in the military before becoming commander in chief  has feuded with gold star families  blasted political opponents on foreign soil  and mocked sen. john mccain  a prisoner of war  for being captured by the enemy. trump’s antipathy for the late senator was so well known that the white house this week requested that the navy keep the uss mccain out of the president’s line of sight during a recent trip to japan  so as not to rile the president. it’s a pattern that is set to get more scrutiny in coming days  as trump heads overseas for the d-day memorial where he will be joined at the service by  among others  house speaker nancy pelosi  a democrat whom he has called “crazy nancy” and warned not to try to impeach him. “it’s unfortunate we have to be even concerned that this historic commemoration will be overly politicized  but this is the command climate he’s created and the reality we have ” said paul rieckhoff  founder and former head of the iraq and afghanistan veterans of america. “we have to send our president. you go with the president we’ve got  and this is the president we’ve got. so we’re rightfully holding our breath for an event like this.” senator elizabeth warren said friday that if elected president  she’ll push legislation to reverse the policy that a sitting president may not be charged with a crime. “i’ve got a plan to make sure that no president is above the law ” she wrote in a post on medium. “congress should make it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity  including obstruction of justice. and when i’m president  i’ll appoint justice department officials who will reverse flawed policies so no president is shielded from criminal accountability.” the justice department’s longstanding policy says that a sitting president cannot be indicted  though there is no law explicitly prohibiting such criminal charges. special counsel robert mueller has cited the policy as part of his rationale for not concluding whether donald trump committed obstruction of justice. “if donald trump were anyone other than the president of the united states right now  he would be in handcuffs and indicted ” warren wrote. the attorney general william barr said he disagrees with the “legal analysis” in special counsel robert mueller’s report – and he’s apparently unconcerned about the beating his reputation is taking because he’s got an eye on his own mortality. “we didn’t agree with the legal analysis  a lot of the legal analysis in the report. it did not reflect the views of the department ” barr told cbs news in an interview that aired friday morning. mueller’s report detailed a number of instances in which donald trump may have obstructed justice  but chose not to reach a conclusion about whether or not he was guilty of the crime. he made a point of saying he was not exonerating trump. “if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime  we would have said so ” mueller said this week. barr  acting on his own  issued the conclusion that trump did not commit obstruction of justice. “we applied what we thought was the right law ” barr said in the cbs interview. “i was trying to state the bottom line.” the ag also said he was unfazed by attacks on his handling of the report  by critics who say he has misled the public and prioritized protecting trump over the integrity of the investigation. “i am at the end of my career ” barr told cbs. “everyone dies and i am not  you know  i don’t believe in the homeric idea that you know  immortality comes by  you know  having odes sung about you over the centuries  you know?” you can read the full interview transcript here.", "judge blocks closure of missouri's

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/31/isis-wife-alleged-kayla-mueller-jailer-umm-sayyaf-husbands-wild-animals", "martin chulov", "at the height of islamic state’s rule  umm sayyaf would regularly prepare her home in eastern syria to receive her husband’s friend. when the bearded man in the black robe arrived she would make tea and lay a platter of food in a sitting room. other doors in the sprawling house in the town of shahadah remained locked; enslaved women and girls from the yazidi community huddled together in one room  and an american hostage  kayla mueller  sat alone in another. the man in the black robe was abu bakr al-baghdadi  the leader of isis  and umm sayyaf’s husband  abu sayyaf – an extremist who had risen through the ranks of the terror group alongside baghdadi to become one of its top three figures – was the isis oil minister. she  meanwhile  came from a well-known iraqi jihadist family: her lineage and spouse earned trust and made her one of the few women to have regular access to the isis leadership – until the day us commandos came for them in may 2015. in the four years since the raid that killed her husband and led to her capture  umm sayyaf  29  otherwise known by her birth name  nisrine assad ibrahim  has been the most important of isis wives in captivity; a keeper of some of the organisation’s darkest secrets and an alleged participant in some of its most depraved acts. one damning charge has remained central to her infamy: that she acted as jailer and enforcer over mueller  a humanitarian worker who had been captured by isis 13 months earlier and was raped by baghdadi in the sayyafs’ home. another is that she enslaved and brutalised nine yazidi women and girls who had been captured in iraq and brought to the isis leaders. umm sayyaf has also been charged by the us government with being a party to a terror conspiracy that led to mueller’s death in raqqa in february 2015. in her first interview  umm sayyaf painted a picture of the isis leadership that reaffirmed stories told by victims of the group’s savagery. she told of the desperate plight of yazidis who were brought to the house  how their arrival stirred up animosity between isis women and their husbands and how mueller had been seen as both a high value prize for isis and a personal possession of baghdadi. she spoke to the guardian  partly through a translator  at a prison in erbil  iraq  where she has been held since a court in the city sentenced her to death. she was accompanied by a kurdish intelligence officer who made no attempt to intervene in the interview. umm sayyaf also described herself as innocent party  who had no choice but to follow orders. her self-portrayal is vehemently disputed by mueller’s parents  marsha and carl mueller  who maintain that umm sayyaf was an architect of their daughter’s suffering – a belief they say has been confirmed by accounts of yazidis who were held captive with her. as isis swept through eastern and northern syria from april 2013  subverting communities  killing at will and sending hundreds of thousands fleeing  the group kidnapped up to three dozen foreigners  whose plight was to play out globally over the next two years. mueller was among them. she had crossed into syria with a friend to help install internet equipment in an médecins sans frontières-run hospital in aleppo in august 2013 and had been kidnapped as she was leaving after an overnight stay. for the next 13 months  before being sent to the sayyafs home  mueller was transferred to several prisons  one of which was a mill outside of raqqa where the largest group of foreigners was held. umm sayyaf corroborates claims that mueller  from prescott in arizona  was brought to the property in shadadah by abu sayyaf around 24 september 2014. at about the same time  he also brought the yazidis. “the yazidi girls changed not only my life  but the lives of all the girls in the islamic state ” she said from a meeting room inside a counter-terrorism prison in erbil. “our husbands became like wild animals when they were around. they had no respect for us.” “but she was treated differently from the yazidis ” umm sayyaf said of mueller. “there was a budget for her. pocket money to buy things from the shop. she was a lovely girl and i liked her. she was very respectful and i respected her. one thing i would say is she was very good at hiding her sadness and pain.” up to 3000 yazidi women were enslaved by isis when its members overran their northern iraqi communities in august 2014. many were passed around between isis members who raped and abused them. throughout the 90-minute interview  she insisted that mueller was considered by both herself and her husband to be “better” than the yazidis. “baghdadi had told her if you become a muslim  you will be free. he stayed with us twice in that month. once he was coming from raqqa to iraq  and the second time from iraq to raqqa.” she reluctantly admitted that the young american had been “owned” by baghdadi  but claimed she did not know what that entailed. the stance conflicts with admissions she made in interrogations with her jailers in erbil and with the fbi  both of whom allege she was tasked with preparing mueller for whenever baghdadi arrived. her claim to have treated mueller kindly is also at odds with what several yazidi girls who escaped the home later told mueller’s parents. according to their accounts  umm sayyaf was as brutal and tyrannical with mueller as she was with them. more than four years after their daughter’s reported death in 2015  the muellers remain deeply angered by what they believe was a slow and unhelpful response from the obama administration to their daughter’s situation  which denied them the tools to negotiate with isis effectively. “what we have learned  we have learned from the brave yazidis who were held captive with kayla ” said marsha mueller  from the family home in arizona. “from what we understand kayla was treated harshly  like the yazidis and like the western hostages. we learned from the young yazidi girls held with kayla that she suffered terribly  but that she tried to hide her own pain. they said kayla was like a mother or a sister  always trying to protect them and encouraging them that one day they would get home. “they made it sound as if kayla put herself in harm’s way to protect them and she suffered physical and emotional retaliation for this. they told us … kayla was writing her family memories and would share them with the girls. kayla was only with the girls that escaped for approximately six weeks  but they seemed to care deeply for each other. they claimed kayla as their own and i believe kayla claimed them as well.” kurdish officials believe the introduction of the yazidi captives angered the senior isis wives and helped crack the group’s watertight secrecy: “they tried to justify what they were doing [raping the women and girls] through the sharia ” a senior kurdish intelligence official said. “but  deep down  the wives never forgave them. and that played a part in their downfall. “[umm sayyaf] said to abu sayyaf: ‘i love you and i don’t want you to be with the yazidis.’ he said: ‘if you don’t like it  you can leave.’ all that support  and she didn’t mean anything to him. we have used this leverage quite a lot and they have been very useful to us.” umm sayyaf said mueller busied herself with learning while in shahadah. “she was all the time reading and writing  every time i saw her she was busy with books. when i was cooking  she came to me and said: ‘teach me what you are doing.’ abu sayyaf told her not to ask me any questions. i asked her how they captured her. we used to call her ‘iman’. once i asked her what her real name was  and she replied ‘kayla’. now on death row  umm sayyaf says she last saw mueller in late 2014  when baghdadi arrived from iraq. “he took her with him in a simple car  a kia. he was driving  and they went to raqqa.” three months later  when she and abu sayyaf were also in the syrian city  she saw a news report about mueller’s death. “i went and asked my husband about it. he looked as shocked as i was.” how mueller died remains disputed. isis claims she was killed in an airstrike launched to avenge the public burning to death of a captured jordanian pilot days earlier. the us government denies a strike took place at the time  and says isis killed her. the family received three photos of what was purported to be mueller’s body  in the last of 27 emails they exchanged with the terror group. the fruitless correspondence still stings deeply. “isis kept indicating that they were willing to release kayla  but of course there had to be some negotiation and the administration at that time kept sending [clear] messages that they were not interested [in negotiating with isis] ” said marsha mueller. “they were not truthful with us  only when their hand was forced by damage control did they tell us what we needed to have known if we were to act effectively on behalf of our kayla to secure her release and keep her from the horrific torture and suffering she endured. “can you imagine? our own government who i trusted completely to help us  who we were given every detail of what we knew  took what we gave them to use  but did not share with us what was happening to our daughter. “we feel that they used kayla and us simply for their own motives to get baghdadi and score a political victory. we believe kayla was taken by al-baghdadi to rape and torture because it provided a powerful political statement that he  not the us  had the upper hand. kayla was used differently because she was a high-value political prisoner  but she was still a prisoner – their prisoner – and she suffered in ways we believe were avoidable if the administration in office at that time had been honest with us.” the muellers also direct criticism at msf: they say isis had passed on email details to its staff through which the family could begin negotiations. “but msf withheld [for several weeks] the information with which isis had provided them … when we received the address from msf  within hours we had an email from isis.” msf said it withheld the email details out of fear for the safety of other hostages. two months after mueller’s apparent death  the us military finally caught up with the sayyafs  at an oil field about 20 miles (30km) from shahadah. one of the yazidis brutalised at their home had made it to erbil and passed on details of where the couple were staying. “i heard the helicopters  and my husband told me to put on my hijab ” she recalled. “we were going downstairs and they shot him. i was blindfolded and put on the helicopter.” as well as the death sentence  umm sayyaf is also facing efforts to transfer her to the us on terrorism charges. the muellers remain determined to learn the complete truth of their daughter’s captivity  and to secure her legacy. “kayla wouldn’t want us to be concerned only with what happened to her ” said marsha mueller. “the world has to come together and do better by these victims of genocide and terrorism and seek justice not just for the western hostages but for the brutal torture of the yazidis.”", "isis wife and alleged kayla mueller jailer: 'our husbands became like wild animals'",

case pinpointing his location in mosul  the guardian can reveal. the isis woman  nisrine assad ibrahim  better known by her nom de guerre  umm sayyaf  has helped the cia and kurdish intelligence officers build a detailed portrait of baghdadi’s movements  hideouts and networks  investigators have disclosed. the claims have been confirmed by umm sayyaf in her first interview since being captured in a delta force raid in syria four years ago that killed her husband  the then isis oil minister. umm sayyaf  29  is a highly controversial figure who has been accused of involvement in some of the terror group’s most heinous crimes  including the enslavement of the captured us aid worker kayla mueller and several yazidi women and girls  who were raped by senior isis leaders. she was sentenced to death by a court in erbil  iraq  and spoke to the guardian  partly through a translator  at a prison in the city. she was accompanied by a kurdish intelligence officer who made no attempt to intervene in the interview. the human rights lawyer amal clooney has requested umm sayyaf’s transfer from iraq to the us to face justice for her crimes. she told the un security council in april that umm sayyaf “locked them [the captives] in a room  instigated their beatings and put makeup on them to ‘prepare them for rape’.” umm sayyaf was the wife of fathi ben awn ben jildi murad al-tunis  a close friend of baghdadi’s and veteran of the group who held one of its most important roles at the time of his death. in february 2016 she identified a house in mosul in which baghdadi was believed to have been staying. however  according to kurdish officials  us commanders balked at calling for an airstrike on the home  only to later acknowledge the world’s most wanted man had probably been inside – his life spared by hectic activity in the skies over iraq that night and a fear of civilian casualties in the densely packed neighbourhood. “i told them where the house was ” said umm sayyaf. “i knew he’d been there because it was one of the houses that was provided for him  and one of the places he liked the most.” her marriage  and jihadist pedigree – her family had been an integral part of the isis leadership – had given her more proximity to baghdadi than nearly all other isis women. as one of the organisation’s most important wives  she had rare access to meetings and personal discussions and was present several times when baghdadi recorded audio propaganda messages in the home she shared with her husband. “he used to do that in our sitting room in taji [a town in central iraq] ” she said. “my husband was the [isis] media chief then  and baghdadi would visit often.” the may 2015 raid that killed tunis  known as abu sayyaf  and in which umm sayyaf was captured was a turning point in the five-year war against isis that culminated in its battlefield defeat two months ago in its last redoubt of baghuz  about 60 miles (95km) from where she was seized in the omar oil field  where they had been based. abu sayyaf had led forces who had commandeered syria’s oil-producing facilities and used the proceeds to fund the terror group’s consolidation and expansion across eastern syria and western iraq. his death crippled the terror group’s cashflow and slowed its momentum. umm sayyaf at first refused to cooperate with her captors and remained sullen and sometimes volatile in her cell in northern iraq. but by early 2016  she had begun to reveal some of the organisation’s most sensitive secrets  none more so than how baghdadi moved around and operated. for many hours umm sayyaf pored over maps and photographs laid out on a table in front of her  alongside american men. “they were very polite and wore civilian clothes ” she said. “i showed them everything i knew.” she soon became integral to an intelligence-gathering effort alongside us and kurdish officers that led them to a hideout in the west of the city that had been prepared for baghdadi by her aunt. “her name is saadia ibrahim ” said umm sayyaf. “two of her sons have died with isis. and she has been with baghdadi since the beginning. she runs the safe house network for him. she is the sister of my father.” speaking about baghdadi  she said: “he visited us often in syria. before we moved to omar [oil field]  we lived in a house in shadadah [a nearby town]”. it was there that mueller was held for a month in late 2014  along with up to nine yazidi women and girls who were captured in august that year and enslaved by isis. umm sayyaf is accused by the us government of holding the aid worker hostage  along with the yazidis  and of being a party to the sexual abuse of mueller at the hands of baghdadi. mueller is believed to have died in raqqa in february 2015. umm sayyaf denied the allegations. “whatever he did did not involve me ” she said of baghdadi. “sometimes he would come for a few hours. sometimes he would stay longer. it was just a normal house  and i provided him and my husband tea. we would also go to raqqa with him  i remember going twice. i told the americans where the house was. they blindfolded us every time we entered the street  but i had been there before  and i knew what it looked like.” a senior kurdish intelligence official said of umm sayyaf’s collaboration: “she gave us a really clear picture of abu bakr al-baghdadi’s family structure and the people who mattered most to him. we learned about the wives of the people around him in particular  and that has been very useful for us. she identified lots of people and their responsibilities. and she gave us a sense of the real feelings of the leadership wives.” a second senior intelligence officer said that in the mosul case  sources on the ground in one of the areas of west mosul that umm sayyaf had identified began to pick up an unusual pattern of movement. “they used to put their guards on the street  these were the internal security people  who only hang around when someone important is there. soon  we zeroed in on the house  and we were very confident that baghdadi was there. we told the americans and asked them to act  and they said they had other things on. baghdadi moved houses quite quickly and we missed him. later  the americans came back and said we were right.” of baghdadi’s whereabouts now  umm sayyaf suggested he had returned to iraq  where he always felt safer. “he never felt good in syria  he always wanted to be in iraq. he would only come to do something and leave. the last i heard of him  he wanted to go to qaim and bukamal  but that was some time ago.” umm sayyaf receives a monthly visit from her family  and has access to doctors and aid workers. despite her cooperation with authorities  she is unlikely to earn a change to her sentence. “we will not let her go ” said the second intelligence chief. “she comes from a very radical environment  and if she returned to them  she would become like them.”", "isis wife reveals role in helping cia

yes  he might’ – which could work to the advantage of peace ” burt said of bolton. “but who knows?” the former minister said it was clear the “bludgeoning stick is being beaten over iran” but doubted a policy of maximum pressure would succeed. “the iran crisis cries out for negotiation  but instead of bringing parties in and saying ‘this is what we need to do’  the posture is ‘it is blindingly obvious that these people are villains and if you are not for us  you are against us  and you will have to pay the consequences.’ “we share their concerns  but that approach does not bring people around the table or  seemingly  end the threats.” he  however  called on iran to show restraint in yemen  where it backs the houthi rebels against a saudi-led coalition. “i cannot understand why they are taking such a risk for something that means so little to them ” he said  adding that iran could not exercise influence in yemen as it does in lebanon through its hezbollah proxies. “iran has no serious reason to be present in yemen and it is quite clear that this conflict cannot end with sana’a as the new beirut. that is no recipe for peace for the yemeni people.” burt stressed that iran  and others in the region  must compromise  but challenged the belief that sanctions were the most effective route to achieve this. “in the past year  there has been no evidence that us actions have changed the way tehran has worked  in fact  it allows tehran to double down. the iranian revolutionary guards corps is more powerful and the hardliners are able to isolate the reformers.” he added that the us threat to impose sanctions on europe for trading with iran was “pretty worrying” and marked a new moment in foreign policy. burt admitted the uk foreign office had tried hard to persuade the us not to quit the nuclear deal last year  and probably misled itself into thinking it might be winning the argument. “in hindsight  i suspect we were not close at all because it was becoming clear that the standout feature of trump  and this is to some degree a credit  is that the president was determined to deliver on his election pledges and leaving [the iran deal] was one of those signature issues. “it does not matter how out of line the decision  he had said he would do it and he does. it’s  however  a doubtful virtue – it’s the quality of the decision which must ultimately count”. burt called for a grand bargain in the middle east to allow the region to focus on issues such as the climate crisis while lowering the risk of conflict. “if nothing changes  this is going to get worse and somebody somewhere is going to do something stupid and you will have the modern equivalent of the archduke being shot in some nameless street in sarajevo. “everyone is on a really dangerous trajectory. each actor is motivated by fear of one another.”", "trump’s ‘hit them first’ diplomacy risks war – ex-uk minister", "2019-05-31t11:26:32z", "middle east and north africa";"trump administration";"us news";"iran";"iran nuclear deal";"world news";"iran's nuclear programme";"us politics";"john bolton"

all faiths and none are being urged to wear kippah skullcaps on saturday as a symbol of solidarity with the jewish community  after a steep rise in antisemitic attacks. protests across the country have been called by the government’s antisemitism ombudsman after he triggered a heated debate when he warned jews last week not to wear the kippah because of the increasing likelihood of being attacked. the german tabloid newspaper bild has been one of the most vocal supporters of the protests  even publishing a cut-out kippah for readers to download and print. felix klein  who was appointed as antisemitism ombudsman a year ago  told german media last week: “i cannot recommend that jews wear the kippah whenever and wherever they want in germany  and i say this with regret.” he cited a 20% rise in attacks on jewish citizens since 2018. last year  1800 antisemitic attacks were reported  involving verbal and physical abuse and death threats. the real figure is thought to be much higher. in april  the rabbi for cologne’s 4000-strong jewish community  yechiel brukner  said he would no longer travel on public transport because of the abuse he had received  including a death threat. in the run-up to the european parliamentary elections earlier this month  campaigners for the far-right die rechte party drove past a synagogue in the city of pforzheim shouting “leave germany” and “go back to israel” from the open windows of their bus  which displayed a prominent picture of a convicted holocaust denier. klein said his warning came amid “mounting disinhibition and spreading of views which poses a fatal breeding ground for antisemitism”. according to the ombudsman  90% of the threats to jews in germany come from far-right extremists  while most of the remaining 10% come from long-term muslim residents. “many of them watch arabic television channels  in which a fatal picture of israel and of jews is conveyed ” klein said. he has called for extra support to educate the police  judges and other state officials who he said were insufficiently informed about the problem or how to deal with it. klein’s recommendation not to wear the kippah was met with a mixture of defiance and shock. joachim herrmann  the bavaria interior minister  said the warning was the equivalent of giving in to the far right. he urged jews to ignore klein’s warning and to continue wearing the kippah. “if we cave in to hatred towards jews  we are doing nothing other than handing the playing field to rightwing ideology ” he said. the prominent german jewish publisher michel friedman said klein’s warning amounted to an “admission of failure by the state”  in contravention of article four of germany’s constitution  which guarantees the right to religious freedom. “obviously the state is failing to enable this for all jewish citizens in their normal lives ” he said. mike pompeo  the us secretary of state  expressed his disquiet during a visit to berlin on friday. “we were concerned to see jews discouraged from wearing the yarmulke [another name for the kippah] in public out of safety concerns. none of us should shrink in the face of prejudice ” he said at a press conference. klein said while announcing saturday’s protests that his earlier warning was meant as a “wake-up call” and that the coming together of politics and society would offer “a real chance to win the battle against antisemitism”. the kippah protest has been called to coincide with al-quds day  when protesters gather to remember the occupation of east jerusalem by israel during the six-day war in 1967. al-quds is the arabic name for jerusalem. the demonstration is typically a magnet in central berlin for anti-israel demonstrators  and attracts hezbollah and hamas sympathisers as well as neo-nazis sporting antisemitic slogans and symbols. the demonstration – dubbed deutschland trägt kippa (germany wears the kippah) – has been welcomed by josef schuster  the president of the central council of jews  who said it was a sign of solidarity and “helpful but insufficient”. “antisemitism must be tackled on many different levels ” he said. he urged children and young people to be cautious  calling on them to “preferably wear a cap over your kippah” in towns and cities with a particular reputation for antisemitic attacks  as he had done for years. the demonstration was hopefully an indication “that the state is finally treating antisemitism with the seriousness that it deserves”  he said. earlier this week angela merkel said in an interview that antisemitism continued to be a problem in germany more than seven decades after the end of the holocaust  in which 6 million jews were murdered by the nazi regime. “we have always had a certain amount of antisemites among us ” the chancellor said in an interview with cnn. “unfortunately there is to this day not a single synagogue  not a single daycare centre for jewish children  not a single school for jewish children that does not need to be guarded by german policemen.” the government spokesman steffen seibert said state institutions had a duty to ensure “that every person can be safe everywhere in this country”. in an editorial bild said the fact that jewish people were having to hide their religion in order to feel safe seven decades after the holocaust meant “we are failing before our own history”.", "all germans urged to wear kippah in protest against antisemitism", "2019-05-31t11:20:02z", "germany";"antisemitism";"judaism";"europe";"religion";"world news";"the far

we all generate rubbish and i decided that was the solution.” the children bring plastic bottles  used school exercise books and old newspapers to a kiosk at their school where it is weighed and their bank accounts are credited with the corresponding amount of money. josé adolfo struck deals with local recycling companies to pay his bank’s clients a slightly higher price than normal; for example 0.80 peruvian soles (0.19 gbp) a kilogram of plastic or white paper. “we don’t want them to be in the street collecting rubbish but at home stopping the rubbish from reaching the street. so in their homes  they put out boxes for cardboard  paper  bottles – they start collecting and it becomes valuable ” josé adolfo explains. his efforts have not gone unnoticed by peru’s environment ministry  which has made home recycling one of its principal campaigns. the country has introduced a law to tackle its estimated 18000 tonnes of solid waste a day  half of which is not disposed of in landfills and ends up on streets  beaches and in rivers. “he’s making an incredible change in financial structuring and financial education that perhaps many adults could not have come up with ” said peru’s environment minister  lucía ruiz  as she joined josé adolfo at a recent event in arequipa. “by joining that with recycling and the handling of waste  a serious problem in our country  he’s scoring a double goal because he’s not just designing a financial opportunity for children and teenagers but also helping to reduce the amount of waste in the country.” “it’s a very hectic life for a 14-year-old ” josé adolfo says. “even so  i’m passionate about what i do and i always tell people they should do what they like rather than what others believe they should do.” the bank recycles about four tonnes of material a month and has kiosks in seven schools in arequipa; more are on a waiting list. increasingly the model is in demand in the rest of peru and abroad. meanwhile  josé adolfo is studying online as he no longer has time to attend school. “he’s given up many childhood things – games  activities  what normal children do – but he too is a normal child  he just sees things differently and thinks in another way ” says his father  herbert quisocala  who left his job a year ago to help his son. “if he wants to cry  i’m here to help him understand that life is like that and you have to learn to accept the good with the bad.” this article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. what else should we cover? email us at theupside@theguardian.com", "the green bank for kids - set up by a child", "2019-05-31t06:00:26z", "environment";"peru";"children";"banking";"recycling";"americas";"business";"world news";"plastics";"waste";"poverty";"ethical and green living"

closures across the uk reach an all-time high  affecting an estimated half a million patients last year. according to research by the medical website pulse  138 surgeries shut their doors in 2018  compared with just 18 in 2013. data released under freedom of information by 186 out of 217 clinical commissioning groups and health boards revealed that smaller surgeries – those serving 5000 or fewer patients – were the worst affected in 2018  accounting for 86% of closures. one doctor told how after 26 years he gave up his gp surgery in brighton  where he and his partner were run off their feet looking after 6500 patients. “the money was just falling away ” he said. “we gave the staff six months’ notice and we walked away.” nhs england said its figures showed fewer practice closures and

including on brexit. the former lords speaker frances d’souza  an advocate of reform  said: “there are people who are attending the house of lords who are not contributing  and therefore they are simply redundant.” the steel magnate swraj paul  who only spoke once  defended his claim of more than £47000 of allowances  saying there was “a lot more to be done than making speeches” in the lords

what has happened to the middle class  the [strictures of] bailout oversight  their style in power  a know-all approach and general over-assuredness.” greeks living in other eu countries are believed to have been particularly negatively swayed by perceived concessions over macedonia: in exchange for the neighbouring country agreeing to change its name  the leftist government recognised a macedonian language and ethnicity which has left many enraged. although applauded internationally  the name-change deal was aggressively derided by the conservatives as part of concerted efforts to appeal to nationalist voters globally. tsipras is expected to meet greece’s head of state  president prokopis pavlopoulos  on monday to formally request the dissolution of parliament in the run-up to the snap election. the prime minister has declared himself to be “ready for battle” pitching the fight as one between progressive forces representing “the many” and the old political establishment that brought greece to the brink of financial collapse. a vote for new democracy would take the country back to “the darkness of austerity  the darkness of crisis  the oligarchs  the international monetary fund ” said the 44-year-old leader as he announced the decision to bring the election forward. but short of a miracle few believe he can close the gap. syriza lost 600000 voters since the last general election in september 2015. if  as expected  the leftists receive a drubbing in local runoffs this weekend  analysts say the momentum will almost certainly be with kyriakos mitsotakis  the 51-year-old reformist leader of new democracy. “there’s clearly a lot of soul-searching in syriza but it’s going to be very difficult  practically impossible for them i’d say to win ” said political commentator pandelis kapsis. the spectre of supporters from smaller political forces also voting for new democracy had  he added  increased the probability of the conservatives winning a parliamentary majority – a prospect reflected this week in strident gains on the athens stock exchange. on the left tsipras also faces a challenge from his former finance minister yanis varoufakis  whose mera25 party did unexpectedly well in the european election in greece even if it narrowly missed winning a seat in the eu parliament. no government in greece has escaped the gruelling effects of an economic depression not seen since the return of democracy in 1974. like its predecessors  tsipras’s administration has been left reeling from enforcing the very policies it had once pledged to repeal in return for bailout funds from the eu and imf to shore up the insolvent economy. while the leftists successfully navigated the country’s exit from eight years of bailout oversight and oversaw a noticeable reduction in record levels of unemployment  from 28% in 2013 to less than 20% this year  economic recovery has been slow. tsipras’s last-ditch effort to claw back support by handing out €1bn worth of tax cuts and pension bonuses appeared to have backfired as retirees  perhaps tired of promises  also turned to new democracy. in four years of syriza governance the greek middle class has been all but decimated by runaway taxes imposed as part of a bailout program negotiated in 2015 that saw tsipras sign up to unprecedented budget surpluses of 3.5%. mitsotakis has vowed to reduce both. “one of the biggest reasons for syriza’s defeat is the middle class ” said kaki balli  editor of the sunday avgi paper which reflects syriza’s views. “greece  unlike other european countries  has always had a lot of class mobility. given that every greek wants to belong to the middle class they have been lured by the promise of less taxation and those are promises that new democracy is making.” • this article was amended on 1 june 2019 to remove an incorrect reference to greeks living outside the eu being able to vote in the election.", "tsipras faces fight to stay in power after eu elections mauling", "2019-05-31t04:00:22z", "greece";"politics";"europe";"world news"

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/31/students-protest-across-brazil-over-jair-bolsonaros-sweeping-cuts-to-education", "tom phillips", "tens of thousands of students  academics and teachers have taken to the streets of brazil for their latest mass protest against what they call far-right president jair bolsonaro’s assault on education. up and down the country – from amazon cities to small towns in brazil’s deep south – demonstrators turned out to condemn bolsonaro’s highly controversial moves to slash funding for public education and science. in the capital  brasília  student protesters were filmed burning an effigy of the brazilian president while chanting the increasingly common refrain of his opponents: “hey  bolsonaro go and get fucked”. in the northeastern city of salvador  where a reported 70000 people marched  one dissenter carried a diabolic caricature of bolsonaro stamped with the phrase: “not today satan”. thousands of students marched through downtown rio with placards reading: “education isn’t an expense  it is an investment”. “this isn’t just an attack on universities. it is going to affect all levels of education ” said rodrigo iacovini  an urban planner who joined a march in brazil’s economic capital  são paulo. “we knew it would be bad – but not this bad ” iacovini  33  said of bolsonaro’s six-month-old administration. “unfortunately  they have shown themselves to be not just a conservative government  but a completely incompetent conservative government that is utterly detached from the brazilian reality.” tanisia maria almeida  a masters student who demonstrated in the northeastern state of sergipe  said she was horrified by spending cuts she feared would make it harder for students from poor backgrounds to gain an education. thanks to education programs created by the leftist governments of luiz inácio lula da silva and dilma rousseff – university for all and science without borders – almeida said she had secured a degree in bio-medicine and study in the united states. “it makes me so sad that if these cuts happen people who – like me – also aren’t from wealthy families  won’t have the same opportunities i had. this really  really upsets me. i see young people … who want to grow but who will be prevented from doing so by these cuts – or they will have to leave the country.” bolsonaro swept to a landslide election victory last october  capitalising on widespread anger at the left-wing politicians who presided over brazil’s worst ever recession and greatest ever corruption scandal. but six months into the radical populist’s four-year term  opposition is growing with polls showing that about 36% of voters now consider his administration bad or awful  compared to 17% in february. moves to dramatically reduce funding for federal universities – unveiled last month by education minister  abraham weintraub – have caused particular outrage  prompting what observers call the largest protests against a newly installed brazilian president in decades. on 15 may tens of thousands of demonstrators staged nationwide protests against the cuts only to be belittled by bolsonaro as “useful idiots” and “imbeciles”. brazil’s firebrand leader attempted to row back from those characteristically incendiary remarks this week in an interview with record  a sympathetic brazilian broadcaster that has emerged as his answer to trump’s fox news. bolsonaro admitted he had gone too far but again disparaged the protesting students as naive “kids” who were being manipulated by their teachers and “didn’t even know what they were doing”. bolsonaro’s critics credit such comments  and the president’s broader offensive against public education  with helping to unify his opponents. “today’s demonstrations are part of a growing process of social mobilizations against the bolsonaro government ” said juliano medeiros  the president of brazil’s leftist socialism and liberty party (psol). “our main message is that bolsonaro cannot govern with his back turned to brazilian society.” iacovini  who studied at two of brazil’s top federal universities  said that while education cuts had left him feeling “profoundly demoralized” his spirits had been lifted by the scale of recent anti-bolsonaro protests. “it gives me hope that it is possible to resist this government’s regressions … brazilian people are starting to see that the threat this administration poses is a threat to all of us  not just to others.” almeida said she was battling not just the government  but her bolsonarista relatives too. “a large part of my family voted for bolsonaro and they defend what he is doing ” she said. “i just cannot understand how a country that wants to develop starts by cutting something as basic as education.” almeida rejected attempts to characterise the protests as a purely left-wing initiative. “lots of people think this is just a pro-workers’ party (pt) protest. this isn’t true. lots [of the protesters] are. but it is much more against what they are doing than in favour of the pt.”", "students protest across brazil over jair bolsonaro's sweeping cuts to education", "2019-05-30t22:45:58z",

probably  because the franco-german partnership is increasingly needed and increasingly insufficient ” he told the european council on foreign relations. emilio sáenz-francés  a lecturer in history and international relations at madrid’s comillas pontifical university  agreed that the timing was right. “sánchez wants to get spain into the photos with the big players – merkel and macron ” he said. “what’s more  that’s perfectly justified by spain’s clout in europe at the moment. if under franco  spain was the ‘spiritual reserve of the western world’  today it’s the spiritual reserve of europeanism.” sáenz-francés said an active presence in europe could help spain “defuse the big issues” as it continued to grapple with the issue of catalan independence and as the trial of the 12 pro-independence regional leaders drew to a close in madrid. the former catalan president carles puigdemont made his frustration with europe very plain  when on tuesday the independence cause suffered a blow after the european court of human rights (echr) rejected a complaint against spain over the suspension of the catalan parliament’s plenary sitting on 9 october 2017. a day later  puigdemont said he had been denied entry to the european parliament despite winning a seat in the european elections. “one might have imagined that after franco’s death the aim was bring the new spanish democracy up to european standards ” he tweeted. “forty-three years later it’s spanish standards that prevail in european institutions. and still people ask why democracy is receding in europe?” sáenz-francés believes that sánchez – “the great chameleon of spanish politics” – could also reap domestic political benefits from his meal with macron. the psoe may have won the general election  but it fell short of a majority in congress  and will need to manoeuvre carefully to get its leader reinvested. by aligning himself with the french president  sánchez will have put pressure on the spain’s centre-right citizens party  which is part of the same european parliamentary group as macron’s la république en marche party. citizens and the conservative people’s party (pp) have both swung to the right in recent months in an effort to stop voters defecting to the far-right vox party  which won 24 seats in the general elections. vox acted as kingmaker in the creation of a pp-citizens coalition government in andalucía after the regional elections last year and could hold the key to power in madrid’s city council and elsewhere. “by getting close to macron  he puts pressure on citizens at a time when the party is the most sought-after coalition partner in spain ” said sáenz-francés. the move will also put pressure on the pp as vox is allied with far-right european parties including matteo salvini’s league and marine le pen’s national rally  which narrowly defeated en marche last weekend. “sánchez has a great vocation for international politics. he’s also got a bit of an ego – he likes being in the pictures and the things that go with that international style ” said sáenz-francés. “but i think that behind all that  there’s a political intelligence – it all lends prestige to a prime minister  and europe is a way of bringing pressure to bear on other parties in spain.”", "spain's victorious acting pm aims for heart of europe", "2019-05-30t13:52:19z", "spain";"pedro sánchez";"europe";"world news";"european union";"angela merkel";"emmanuel macron"

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/30/revealed-womens-fertility-app-is-funded-by-anti-abortion-campaigners", "jessica glenza", "a popular women’s health and fertility app sows doubt about birth control  features claims from medical advisers who are not licensed to practice in the us  and is funded and led by anti-abortion  anti-gay catholic campaigners  a guardian investigation has found. the femm app  which collects personal information about sex and menstruation from users  has been downloaded more than 400000 times since its launch in 2015  according to developers. it has users in the us  the eu  africa and latin america  its operating company claims. two of the app’s medical advisers are not licensed to practice in the us and are also closely tied to a catholic university in santiago  chile  where access to abortion remains severely restricted. femm receives much of its income from private donors including the chiaroscuro foundation  a charity backed almost exclusively by sean fieler  a wealthy catholic hedge-funder based in new york. fieler’s foundation has long supported organizations – and politicians such as the vice-president  mike pence – that oppose birth control and abortion. fieler has criticized republicans for failing to outlaw abortion  calling their reticence “the tyranny of moderation” in a recent editorial. the chiaroscuro foundation  with fieler as its chairman and main backer  provided $1.79m to the developers of the femm app over the last three years  according to irs statements. fieler also sits on the board of directors for the femm foundation  a not-for-profit which operates the app. the femm app does not readily disclose the philosophy of its funders or leaders  and markets itself as a way to “avoid or achieve pregnancy”. other fertility apps have been criticized for monetizing intimate data  sharing data with third parties and lack of privacy protections. femm has not been accused of such behaviour  but appears to be the first ideologically aligned fertility app. the femm app’s literature sows doubt about the safety and efficacy of hormonal birth control  asserting that it may be deleterious to a woman’s health and that a safer  “natural” way for women to avoid pregnancy is to learn their cycles. dr lindsay rerko  a physician who is licensed to practice as a family doctor  not a gynecologist  features on femm’s website and writes that the “side effect profiles” of hormonal birth control suggests “they are causing illness and degrading health”. part of the femm app encourages women to visit its own network of physicians for hormone tests  which it claims can diagnose “underlying” medical disorders. in an interview with the guardian  rerko declined to comment on whether she opposes birth control or abortion. in fact  57% of all married or in-union women of reproductive age worldwide use a modern contraceptive method  including condoms  hormonal birth control and implantable devices such as intrauterine devices  according to the united nations in 2015. in north america  69.3% of partnered women of reproductive age use modern methods such as the pill  iuds or implants. fertility awareness birth control methods  such as that promoted by femm  are considered the least effective  resulting in roughly 24 pregnancies for every 100 women using the method a year  according to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). implantable devices are considered the most effective  resulting in one pregnancy for every 2000 women a year. “the birth control pill is one of the greatest health achievements of the 20th century ” said dr nathaniel denicola  an ob-gyn with the american college of obstetrics and gynecology  which has studied fertility apps extensively. “this is part of standard women’s healthcare.” “natural” family planning methods using fertility awareness are known to have a failure rate of about 25 unintended pregnancies for every 100 women a year in the us. anna halpine  ceo of the femm foundation  said the ideology of the group and its funders is irrelevant because the femm app is “not dealing with the question of abortion in the work and the research and training we offer”. “femm has never commented on the abortion issue. and doesn’t work in that area. femm is an organization committed to expanding information research and knowledge about women’s reproductive health around the world ” said halpine. the reproductive health research institute (rhri) provides femm’s medical assertions  research and training. the two physicians leading rhri are listed on its website as pilar vigil and patricio contreras. vigil is listed as the medical director of rhri  which has two addresses  one in new york city and another in santiago  chile. vigil is listed as an ob-gyn and contreras as a “medical doctor”  but neither is licensed to practice medicine in the united states. vigil’s biography lists her postdoctoral studies at the texas institute for reproductive medicine and endocrinology. that institute closed in 2016  and said on its website it is “not processing any more requests for records”. when asked whether the medical advisers to the femm app are licensed to practice medicine in new york or the united states  halpine said: “no.” she added the advisers are primarily in chile. the institute is registered at the same new york city address as the femm foundation and another anti-abortion organization called world youth alliance. when the guardian tried to call rhri  a receptionist answered the phone as the world youth alliance. halpine founded world youth alliance and was listed as ceo on the group’s most recent tax filings. world youth alliance gave femm $446042 between 2016 and 2017. world youth alliance also received funding from chiaroscuro foundation. in multiple papers published by vigil  she is affiliated with the vicerrectoría de comunicaciones pontificia of the universidad católica  chile’s catholic university. in one editorial  titled the harmonious relationship between faith and science  vigil examines the position of catholic saints on science. the guardian contacted a co-author of one peer-reviewed paper promoted by femm foundation’s 2017 annual report. the co-author is listed as santiago molina  a tallahassee  florida  community college anatomy professor. molina said his main contributions were “pondering questions” and translation. a physician who reviewed the paper at the guardian’s request said it “doesn’t really align with any standard of care we practice in the us”. according to the femm foundation’s annual reports  it received $618653 in donations in 2017. the same year  chiaroscuro gave femm $445500  the majority of its budget. chiaroscuro gave an additional $350000 in 2016  and $1m in 2015.", "revealed: women's fertility app is funded by anti-abortion campaigners", "2019-05-30t06:00:03z", "abortion";"apps";"women";"health";"technology";"world

charging him  mueller’s report awarded him “total exoneration”. but mueller said that had simply never been an option. “a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office ” he said. “that is unconstitutional. even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view – that too is prohibited.” it was also against justice department policy  mueller said. many construed mueller’s speech as a signal to congress to impeach trump for obstruction of justice. “beginning impeachment proceedings is the only path forward ” said senator cory booker  in comments

new guinea has appointed james marape as its new prime minister  after a tumultuous few months in the country’s political life. marape  a former finance minister and sometime ally of the outgoing prime minister peter o’neill  was elected by mps who voted overwhelmingly  101 to eight  to make him the next leader. marape  the member for tari-pori in new hela province was a key minister in o’neill’s government and his defection from the government to the opposition camp in april accelerated o’neill’s resignation from office. for a time he was the opposition bloc’s candidate to replace o’neill as prime minister  before he was beaten in a secret ballot to become opposition leader by patrick pruaitch earlier this week. in a sign of the fluid nature of png politics  after o’neill resigned officially on wednesday  marape and his supporters returned to the government camp. the vote came after months of turmoil in the pacific nation  which has seen opposing mps camped out at different hotels in the country’s capital of port moresby  high-level defections between opposing groups  shouting matches on the floor of parliament  and finally  the resignation of former prime minister peter o’neill on the floor of parliament on wednesday. in his speech after his election on thursday  marape said he would make fixing the economy  which he described as “bleeding and struggling”  his priority and sounded a warning to foreign companies working in png. “we will look to maximising gain from what god has given this country from our natural resources. this government is all about putting our country in the right place and taking back our economy … we don’t need foreigners to come in to take advantage of our forestry ” he said. jonathan pryke  director of the lowy institute’s pacific islands program said: “in terms of all the likely outcomes today  this is the one that signals most continuity of policy in papua new guinea.” “you kind of wonder what the last three weeks have been about. it clearly was less about policy and much more about personality and the desire to see a change of leadership and to oust peter o’neill. marape seems to have secured a vast majority of votes in parliament  so has secured a mandate to lead  but we’ll see how markedly his leadership shifts from peter o’neill in the coming weeks.” o’neill  who has led png since 2011  is only the second prime minister in the young country’s history to have served out a full term. the election for o’neill’s replacement was held in png’s parliament on wednesday. marape beat former prime minister and opposition figure sir mekere morauta. in a surprising moment in the day’s proceedings  opposition leader patrick pruaitch nominated o’neill as a candidate for the job that o’neill had resigned just a day earlier. o’neill initially accepted the nomination and then later withdrew his name from the contest. o’neill initially announced he would resign at a media conference on sunday  but opponents doubted the sincerity of this announcement after o’neill then sought legal action to block the the opposition from holding a vote of no confidence in him  however  in a speech to parliament on wednesday  o’neill said he had visited the governor general that morning to tender his resignation  prompting a vote among mps for his replacement on thursday morning. going into wednesday’s parliamentary session  the opposition claimed it had the support of 68 out of the country’s 111 mps  which would have allowed it to ensure their leader  patrick pruatich  a former treasurer  would become the next prime minister. however after o’neill officially resigned on wednesday at least 30 of the country’s mps returned to the government bloc  including high-profile opponents such as james marape and william duma. bryan kramer  an opposition mp who has been one of the o’neill’s most vocal critics  said that among the opposition’s priorities if it came to power  would be to launch an investigation into o’neill’s business practices  which have come under severe criticism  including his handling of a multibillion-dollar gas deal that opponents said was a poor outcome for png. pryke said an investigation into o’neill is now “incredibly unlikely”. “marape and o’neill  despite their disagreements over the last three weeks  have been very close throughout marape’s political career ” said pryke  who said it was likely that o’neill would be appointed to marape’s cabinet. “keep him close ” said pryke. “despite the fact he lost a vote on the floor of parliament yesterday  he’s proven himself to be a master politician.” o’neill came to power in 2011 in circumstances that were later ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court. despite this contentious start  there was a wave of optimism when o’neill came to power after he initiated an anti-corruption investigation called task force sweep. however  optimism in o’neill’s leadership faded after o’neill became a target of investigations over allegations he authorised payments of $30m for fraudulent legal bills. o’neill denied the allegations and the government disbanded the task force. scandals surrounding his business dealings have continued to dog o’neill throughout his prime ministership  and he was forced to step down after after high-profile mps left his government for the opposition over the last month. “it is important that i vacate this seat  so that we can be able to move on ” he told parliament on wednesday. o’neill listed his achievements as prime ministers included the country’s hosting of the apec summit last year and the expansion of the education sectors and the delivery of infrastructure projects. he also said his government was able to improve

[the government] has a chance now to prove its commitment to international agreements and treaties.” ben emmerson qc  the british barrister representing three of the detained catalan mps  said: “this decision should mark a turning point in spanish policy towards catalonia. spain is acting in flagrant violation of international law  and it had been called out by the un body with ultimate authority on the question of arbitrary detention. “if spain does not immediately release all the political prisoners  and sit down at the negotiating table  the government in madrid will soon find itself struggling against the tide of international public opinion. “the spanish government needs to shake off the authoritarian instincts that are a hangover from franco’s enduring dictatorship  and move very rapidly into the 21st century. modern democracies do not lock up democratically elected politicians simply because they argue for independence. that is the hallmark of repressive regimes  and has no place in the european democratic order.” puigdemont said he wanted to take his seat in the european parliament but spain needed to lift the threat of arrest against him. he was detained last year in germany on an international arrest warrant issued by a judge in spain. he said while he felt free to travel throughout europe  apart from spain  he “can’t return [to catalonia] without the danger of being arrested”. the spanish government has not replied to his request to re-enter the country without being arrested. he said he would campaign in the european parliament for “the right of self-determination in order to prevent and resolve conflicts and also to support democracy against the rise of populism”. puigdemont added he had been in contact with the pro-independence scottish national party in the past and hoped to work with it in the eu parliament. carlos bastarrache  the spanish ambassador to london  demanded the un conduct an audit of how the report came to be compiled and leaked  claiming “rules of procedure had not been respected”. speaking at a briefing in london  he described the report as “a clear interference in the spanish courts of justice with the clear objective of continuing to attack the judicial system in spain.” he said the report itself was marked by a lack of rigour and based on a series of false premises including the legality of the referendum. he added there had been no restrictions on freedom of expression  as the report claimed. additional reporting by patrick wintour", "un report proves catalan separatists 'political prisoners'  says puigdemont", "2019-05-29t13:52:36z", "catalonia";"carles puigdemont";"spain";"united nations";"human rights";"europe";"world news"

(this is an edited extract). the first day: “thoroughly satisfactory” 7 june 1944 the allied invasion of france “is proceeding in a thoroughly satisfactory manner.” mr. churchill  giving this news in the house of commons last night  added the following details:- our troops have penetrated in some cases several miles inland. lodgments exist on a broad front. the airborne troops  lauded with extremely little loss and with great accuracy  are well established  and the follow-ups are all proceeding with very much less loss than we expected. we have captured important bridges which were not blown up by the enemy. fighting is proceeding in the town of caen  10 miles inland. the passage of the sea was made with far less loss than we apprehended  and “many dangers and difficulties which appeared at this time last night extremely formidable are behind us.” according to german reports  our airborne troops are involved in the fighting in caen. british pilots  however  report seeing allied tanks moving towards that town. general eisenhower’s second communique  issued a few minutes before midnight  deals mainly with the naval and air operations preparatory to and during the landings. naval casualties  it says  were regarded as being very light  “especially when the magnitude of the operations is taken into account.” on the beaches: guardian reports from the d-day landings 7 june 1944 there is a feeling of confidence at this headquarters tonight [6 june]. no one imagines that the supreme battle which began on the beaches of normandy early this morning will be won by the allies without bitter fighting against a determined and desperate enemy  but there is a general sense that the “first hurdles” of invasion of the european continent have been successfully surmounted. our london correspondence 7 june 1944 many people were wakened about five this morning  by the thundering passage of the air armies on and on overhead  and many got up to see them and wondered if the day had come. at breakfast in my hotel the news was spreading. some women sat at table eating nothing  with their hands clasped before them. airmen on leave grouped together. the girls selling flags for the red cross had no small talk. there was none of the coming together of strangers as one remembered on the big days in the last war or in the earlier eventful days in this war. “why aren’t the church bells ringing” was the only outspoken thing i heard. gatherings found the news-sellers were the only signs on the streets. everyone was thinking of someone over there in the liberation. de gaulle in london londoners would have liked to give a welcome to general de gaulle  but learnt to-day that he had been among them for several days unannounced. he is staying with his daughter at one of those small but exclusive hotels in mayfair which are scarcely known outside the quarter. the general looks an older  a more haggard man than when we saw him last. he  too  was unsmiling and grim on d day. editorial: by word of mouth 7 june 1944 with the help of the wireless and the aeroplane the war now comes home very quickly to those who wait and hope. dancers at that famous ball in brussels may have heard the cannon’s opening roar for waterloo  but it was long enough before london had firm news of the actual victory. after months of silence and suspense the new assault on europe came to us both nearly and swiftly with the many bbc announcements and recordings of yesterday. the recording from an aeroplane flying over france as the invasion was launched  the words of general eisenhower  and the messages of the premiers of occupied countries to their own people – these bring urgency and actuality to bear on the news of the day in a way which has never been possible in any earlier struggle. one of the most moving of these records was the repeated instructions to people living near the coasts that are or will be invaded and warning them that they must be ready to leave their homes and all their belongings save the little that they can carry when news comes to them that the allied air offensive is about to break on specific german strongholds and communications. the notice so given cannot be a long one  for otherwise it would be a warning to the enemy as well. we can feel for those who  having been been at the mercy of the germans  must now fly from their friends. the same fate would have been ours in 1940 had hitler had means and opportunity to enforce it. invasion films: news reels reach manchester 9 june 1944 the first of the news-reel films of the invasion  made by paramount and british movietone news  were shown in manchester yesterday at the tatler news theatre. though these exciting records of the events of d-day do not include films of the actual landings  they cover many other operations on these coasts and in france  and are particularly good in showing the part played by the air-borne troops. editorial: d-day and the longest lesson 4 june 1994 john major is the first prime minister of modern times who cannot remember the second world war. born in 1943  he was a baby when a v-1 rocket landed near his home  exploding with such force that shattering glass spattered the cot in which our future leader lay asleep. yet like many of his generation mr major still bears the imprint of the war in all kinds of inner ways. he may not have been on the normandy beaches himself but he knows how powerfully this weekend’s d-day commemorations will still resonate  even now  among many millions of british people. the invasion of france in june 1944 was a defining moment in british history. at the time  it appeared to define british military greatness afresh and restate this country’s continuing claim to a share of global power. yet in retrospect d-day appears more as the defining moment at which our geopolitical greatness came to an end.

story: speaker warns brexiters they cannot defy parliament good morning briefers. i’m martin farrer and it’s my pleasure to bring you the top stories this wednesday morning. john bercow plans to stay on as speaker of the house of commons in a move that is likely to enrage brexit-supporting conservative backbenchers who believe he is biased towards the remain camp. speaking after making a speech in washington dc  bercow said it was not “sensible to vacate the chair” while there were major issues before parliament. bercow had told friends that he would stand down in july after 10 years in the chair  but he has appeared to rule that out in favour of seeing parliament through the brexit crisis. bercow also doubled down on his standoff with eurosceptics by saying that whoever replaced theresa may as prime minister would not be able to impose a no-deal brexit on the country if parliament remained opposed to the idea. it will be seen as a rebuke to leading contenders such as boris johnson and dominic raab  who have both championed the no-deal option regardless of what mps might say. another tory leadership contender  rory stewart  rejected suggestions that he only entered the race as a “suicide bomber” who could clear a path for michael gove. meanwhile  the incumbent in no 10 warned that her successor would have to find a consensus in parliament before britain could leave the eu. however  things are arguably even worse for labour with the party under formal investigation for antisemitism by the equality and human rights commission  alastair campbell expelled for voting lib dem and heartland voters deserting for the brexit party. * * * hacking claim – saudi arabia has been accused of hacking the electronic devices of a dissident who is believed to be living in britain under police protection. the allegation is contained in a letter of claim which was delivered to the saudi embassy in london on tuesday and was sent on behalf of the saudi satirist ghanem almasarir. it says he was targeted by saudi arabia with malware via suspicious texts and corrupt links. the malware was developed by the israeli surveillance company nso and has allegedly been used in the past by saudi arabia and other governments to target journalists  human rights campaigners and political activists. the saudis have six weeks to settle the claim before the accusations are formally taken to court.

only one-quarter of the total number of faulty cars have been removed  a study shows  and it will take another two years to recall the rest. florent grelier  of transport and environment  which conducted the analysis  said the slow progress was “unacceptable” and showed that brussels lacked the political will to impose mandatory recalls on the car industry. eu sources said they did not want to “emotionalise” the debate by framing the lack of action by member states as unacceptable. * * * boat killing – a british man has been jailed for eight years in the us for killing his wife while they were on honeymoon on their yacht in the caribbean. lewis bennett  42  was sentenced yesterday in miami over the death of isabella hellmann  41  as they sailed off the bahamas in 2017. bennett says his wife  with whom he had a young daughter  disappeared overboard when the boat struck something in the water at night. bennett fled the stricken craft and was later found to have been smuggling thousands of dollars worth of rare coins. his wife’s body has never been found. * * * abortion battle – the us supreme court has signalled it is more open to state restrictions on abortions by upholding an indiana law supported by pro-life groups that regulates the disposal of fetal remains. but the justices yesterday evaded the question of a broader provision that would prevent a woman in the state from having an abortion based on gender  race or disability. in missouri  officials indicated that they might not renew the licence of the only abortion clinic in the state which would make it the only one in the country without such a facility. the moves are the latest in a series of cases seen as potential springboards for anti-abortion campaigners to challenge the landmark 1973 decision roe v wade  which paved the way for its legalisation across the us. * * * from mao to the modern – seventy years ago  china fell to forces led by mao zedong  ushering in a communist party

burke", "when armed men fired on protesters in the sudanese capital khartoum earlier this month  killing six and injuring dozens  witnesses were quick to blame the rapid support forces  a feared paramilitary outfit. the forces are commanded by mohamed hamdan dagalo  known as hemedti  who also serves as deputy head of the transitional military council  which has been running sudan since omar al-bashir was ousted by the army after months of protests on 11 april. though witnesses saw troops in rsf-marked vehicles opening fire as they cleared barricades  hemedti said those responsible for the violence had been found inside khartoum university and the protesters’ encampment. “these people have been arrested and confessed on camera ” he said  without offering further details or proof. bashir’s 30-year rule had been marked by civil war and widespread human rights abuses. the generals who seized power have resisted calls from the demonstrators and the international community to step down  insisting a new governing body be led by an officer. as talks over the governing body remain deadlocked  hemedti has increasingly been seen as a key player. his influence was underlined on friday when it emerged he had met the saudi crown prince  mohammed bin salman  while on a visit to saudi arabia. riyadh has emerged as a key supporter of the new rulers of sudan since bashir’s fall. the rsf has been repeatedly deployed in recent years to crack down on pro-democracy and other protesters. around 10000 rsf paramilitaries are deployed or close to khartoum  observers say. hemedti has warned protesters against any further “chaos”  hinting late last month that the military may use force if the unrest continues. but he has also repeatedly said he would like to see democracy in sudan and he refused orders from bashir to violently disperse the sit-in outside the military headquarters in the capital that precipitated the dictator’s fall. last week  he told egypt’s state newspaper al-ahram that the ruling military council “wants to hand over power today not tomorrow”. western envoys and opposition activists in khartoum say hemedti  who comes from a family of camel traders in a remote province and dropped out of primary school  hopes to become president. “hemedti planned on becoming the number one man in sudan. he has unlimited ambition ” said an opposition figure who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. analysts say hemedti is backed by an informal coalition of diverse supporters. some see him as an ally against the islamist movement that orchestrated the 1989 coup  which brought bashir to power and underpinned his regime. hemedti also supplied ground forces to the saudi-led coalition fighting iran-aligned rebels in yemen and can count on the support of the saudis  the united arab emirates and egypt  all of whom hope to sideline the islamists. his rise is closely linked to the ongoing conflict in his native darfur  where his forces are accused of continuing the scorched-earth campaign against rebels that bashir launched in 2003  and for which the former president was indicted for war crimes and genocide by the international criminal court. about 300000 people were killed and 2.7 million were forcibly displaced in the early years of that conflict  when the government-backed janjaweed militia torched villages and killed and raped ethnic africans across the darfur region. in an interview with documentary filmmakers in 2008  hemedti said bashir had personally asked him to lead the campaign against the insurgency in darfur but he denied any involvement in attacks on civilians and said he had refused orders to attack civilian areas. magdi el-gizouli  a scholar at the rift valley institute  a thinktank focused on east africa  said hemedti’s rise was enabled by the sudanese military’s strategy of outsourcing counter-insurgency operations to local forces. “in essence  he is the reason why the rebellion in darfur was defeated  because he was capable of recruiting an efficient fighting force that knew the local terrain well  that knew the geography well  and that had an axe to grind against farming communities in darfur ” he said. sudan’s pro-government militia were eventually reorganised into the rsf in 2013 in an attempt to impose greater discipline and more closely tie them to the armed forces. under hemedti’s command  the rsf waged two major counterinsurgency campaigns in darfur  in 2014 and 2015. a 2015 report by the new-york-based human rights watch found the rsf had “committed a wide range of horrific abuses”  including forcibly displacing entire communities  destroying wells and plundering livestock. “among the most egregious abuses against civilians were torture  extrajudicial killings and mass rapes ” it said. witnesses to a 2015 attack by the rsf in darfur’s jebel marra region said troops had carried out mass rape in and around the village of golo  often gang-raping women and girls in front of local elders before killing the women and leaving their bodies in the streets  human rights watch said. the international criminal court has not brought charges against hemedti. but it said in a 2014 report the rsf under his command was “similar in structure and modus operandi” to earlier militia  with a “similar pattern of indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks against civilians”.", "hemedti: the

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/29/chaos-hope-change-stories-from-70-years-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china", "lily kuo", "this year marks 70 years since mao zedong stood in tiananmen square in beijing and declared the beginning of the people’s republic of china. to the outside world  china’s transformation from a poor agrarian society into one of the world’s most powerful economies is nothing short of miraculous. “if you think about what china was 70 years ago  essentially a country that had fought its way through two wars and was on its knees and battered – the idea that in 70 years it would be the second biggest economy in the world… and a major global player would have seemed very unlikely indeed ” said rana mitter  a professor of history and politics of modern china at oxford university. but for those who lived through these years  the pace of change has been dizzying and at times jolting. almost no other country has experienced shifts as dramatic as china has – almost as if each generation has lived in an entirely different country. the chinese who grew up in the early days of the people’s republic remember ration cards  mass hunger  and political campaigns like the cultural revolution  which upended the country between 1966 and 1976 and whose effects still linger today. those in the 1980s remember a time of optimism and openness  amid a growing belief that economic reforms be accompanied by political ones  liberalising both the economy and the political system. that chapter of openness was slammed shut by the end of the decade when the chinese military crushed student protests on 3-4 june  1989. the nation will remember the tiananmen square protests on their 30th anniversary next week. in the decade after the crackdown the chinese leadership  faced with a crisis of legitimacy  pursued economic opening even more aggressively  opening stock markets  reforming state-owned companies  and encouraging imports and exports  all in the name of creating a “socialist market economy”. as a result  chinese millennials have grown up in relative wealth as the country became the world’s manufacturer. at the same time  they have experienced even more control  censorship and surveillance  aided by advances in chinese technology. “it’s not just a generation gap  it’s a ‘generation grand canyon’ ” says maura cunningham  a historian who specialises in modern china. the ruling chinese communist party has hailed the last seven decades as an undeniable success in nation building  a credit to the government’s steady hand. while official accounts may skip over  rewrite or erase the country’s darker chapters  those who lived through them cannot. the picture  according to their stories  is not so clear cut. “we can’t have chaos” (1949-mid-1960s) zhang xizhen was four years old when the people’s liberation army entered beijing on 31 january 1949. after a 40-day siege of the former imperial capital  the nationalist army that controlled the city surrendered  hastening the end of a civil war that had taken up most of the last two decades. zhang’s father  a lieutenant in the nationalist or kuomintang army  was one of those troops who yielded the city without fighting. after that  things changed quickly. the family  including zhang and her five siblings  was soon moved out of their spacious house  with a living room and modern flushing toilets  and into a small two-room hutong  or alley  home. her father made it through the political campaigns and interrogations. because of earlier work helping an underground communist cell  he was given a piece of paper signed by mao  acknowledging his contribution. zhang’s mother wrapped it up in oil paper and kept it in the toilet  in case his fellow kuomintang searched their home. he was able to find work with the ccp  and though he was never officially allowed to join the party  he could earn a living for the family  about 80 yuan a month. to zhang  in primary school  the 1950s were a simple time. they didn’t have much after the communist takeover  officially known as “liberation”  but the flattening of social classes and overhaul of the economy meant no one had much. “we just felt happy to have new clothing for spring festival ” she says  referring to chinese new year. “my classmates and i were happy as long as there was food and school to go to.” but by the early 1960s  when zhang was a teenager  her family was one of millions across the country struggling for enough to eat  a time known as the “three years of difficulty”. it was caused by the great leap forward  an unrealistic industrialisation program to put china ahead of the uk in terms of production within 15 years. as many as 45 million people starved to death by the time the program was abandoned. zhang  a singer  had joined a state dance and ensemble troupe  where her rations were slightly more. she brought them home every weekend to give to her mother. “my mother weighed all the food before every meal ” she recalled. “she had to plan to make sure everything lasted until the end of the month.” sometimes they would grind the core of an ear of corn  add some beancurd and make it into a cake. “everything that could be eaten was eaten ” she said. zhang’s mother  who ate less so her children could have more  saw her legs swell from malnutrition  a common sight across beijing  where conditions were better than in the countryside. zhang heard stories of people starving to death but no media reported such cases. the “three years of difficulty” were soon followed by another chaotic political movement  the cultural revolution  in which zhang’s father was punished and sent away to serve hard labour  despite his slip of paper signed by mao. only in the late 1970s did things calm down and zhang began to travel the world with the government troupe  performing in jamaica  mexico  and at home. today  she lives in an apartment on the east side of the city with her husband  spending her afternoons playing pool in the building’s recreation room. on the weekends  she takes care of her grandson. the years before have convinced her of the importance of stability  whatever others may say about the importance of democracy and checks and balances in government. “i don’t really know what is better  but right now it’s stable ” she says. “we can’t have chaos. we have been through chaotic times and all kinds of movements. we just want stability.” “many things were ridiculous  even absurd  irrational” (cultural revolution – 1966-1976) zhu xindi was getting ready to take university entrance exams in kunming in the summer of 1966 when the cultural revolution “fell suddenly from the sky”  she says. exams were cancelled  and universities and schools shuttered. zhu  who had been top of her class and planned to take a degree in science and engineering  instead went to the countryside to help build “a bright red new world” like many other youth. the cultural revolution  a decade of social and political chaos kicked off by mao in an effort to reinvigorate the socialist spirit of the country  is one of the least understood events in china’s modern history. even two decades later it is hard for zhu to make sense of it. she spent a year farming and living among the dai  an ethnic minority group  in a village in yunnan province  near china’s border with myanmar. she woke before daybreak and farmed all day. most of the young people she found herself with had never farmed before. their initial revolutionary spirit soon faded. “everyone thought we were about to make great contributions to the nation  that we were going where the country most needed us to build a new socialist countryside ” she says. “when you were actually there  it wasn’t like that. we wanted to leave  but we had no choice.” zhu eventually left  trekking to myanmar in the hopes of aiding communist insurgents. turned away  she travelled throughout yunnan  getting sick and almost going blind in one eye. “for three years  i roamed. i didn’t have food to eat. i was considered mangliu ” she says  referring to herself as a “blind migrant”. zhu’s family also suffered. red guards  overzealous youths tasked with rooting out counterrevolutionaries  beat zhu’s little sister and forced her to shave off her hair. zhu remembers how the family decided to take a family portrait in case they were separated. each person snuck out of the house one by one  so as not to arouse the suspicion of their neighbours  and they met at the photo studio. afterwards  her mother gave each of them a copy to keep. “in case we lose each other  we’ll be easier to find ” zhu remembers her mother saying. after the cultural revolution ended in 1976 and schools reopened  zhu finally took the national exams she was meant to take years earlier. she went to university at the age of 30  studied medicine and became a dentist. retired for the last 10 years  she now lives in hangzhou. she doesn’t feel angry about the years that were taken from her. “it was very difficult and every day i didn’t know if i would make it to tomorrow ” she says. “looking back  you can say many things were ridiculous  even absurd and irrational. but at that time  the whole country was irrational.” she said: “for the generation now  you have choices  and when many choices are put in front of you  you feel lost. but for us  we didn’t have any choices. my whole life  i didn’t have choices  and i did the best i could in the tiny space i had to make choices.” “one step at a time” – (reform and opening 1977-1980s) chong li  a native beijinger  was an early adopter of the market economy. at the age of 19  he borrowed tools from his classmates  set up a shed and began fixing bikes for money. it was a year before deng xiaoping  who later succeeded mao  launched reforms in 1978 that would transform the economy. chong’s neighbours were shocked  causing his parents to worry. the cultural revolution  when people had been severely punished for showing capitalist tendencies  had ended only a few years earlier. chong still remembers a family relative who had been arrested for buying a bag of peanuts at a train station. “all private businesses and shops had been stopped  so people were scared and afraid this would happen again  and they would be beaten down again ” he says of the years before reforms gained speed in the 1980s. “i also struggled mentally. but whether it was real or not  i didn’t think too much. i took one step at a time to see how far i would go. like deng said  ‘crossing the river by feeling the stones’ ” chong says  quoting a famous saying of deng’s to describe china’s gradual marketisation. chong had little choice. the eldest of four siblings  he needed to do something to help support the family. because he was born with cerebral palsy that affected his ability to walk  he had never been given a work assignment or a danwei  a feature of china’s planned economy in the early years. around him  the city was changing. young people who had gone to the countryside during the cultural revolution were returning to cities and looking for work  putting pressure on officials to find employment for them. people began quitting their jobs to run their own businesses. in 1985  you could earn as much as 400 yuan a month on your own  compared to 50 yuan a month as a state employee  according to chong. people began to open restaurants and other entrepreneurs like him began fixing things other than bicycles or torches. households now needed help with their typewriters  radios  televisions  and refrigerators. despite the changes around him  his hutong stayed quiet  without many shops. people went to work in the morning and came back by evening  keeping regular hours. “people were warm to each other ” he says. “they lived well together and weren’t selfish … and they were sincere. that is what made the biggest impression on me and has become my own standard.” chong still tries to maintain some of that same sense. he stopped fixing bicycles about 10 years ago after injuring his hand. now  he runs a small shop selling goldfish and birds. he doesn’t make much money and spends most of his days smoking  painting and chatting with old friends and neighbours. “today there are so many ways of transportation – with shared bikes  didi [a taxi-hailing app]. before  there was nothing like this. people only had their two legs. those who had a bicycle at home were considered well off ” he says. “a seed that keeps growing” (struggle for democracy  1989-1990s) for duan peng  from the south-western city of chengdu  one of the experiences that marked him the most is one he did not understand at the time: the pro-democracy protests that swept china in the spring of 1989. after more than a decade of china’s gaige kaifang  reform and opening  young chinese were emboldened to air their opinions and grievances. in the spring of 1989  chinese students in beijing  chengdu  and other cities took to the streets to mourn the death of the country’s reformist leader  hu yaobang. in chengdu  as in beijing  the gathering morphed into protests against government corruption and eventually calls for freedom and democratic rights. duan  in high school at the time  understood little of the slogans the students were shouting. but he would sneak out of his home at night to join the students marching through the city. “i thought it was fun  walking along the roads  with no police around. it was exciting ” duan says. on 4 june 1989  the same day protests in beijing had been crushed by the chinese military  police also moved against students in chengdu  using tear gas  knives  and electric cattle rods  according to witnesses  who said they saw soldiers stacking bodies in trucks. duan had tried to get to the protests that day but police blocked off the roads. he heard rumours of gunfire and remembers burning cars and fires in the city’s public squares. he had heard that students in beijing had been killed and soldiers burned alive. in chengdu  the death toll would be as many as 300  according to us diplomatic cables later leaked. after the protests duan finished high school  went to vocational school and became an architect at his father’s urging. the country was on the cusp of an economic boom. he moved south to shenzhen  which soon emerged as one of china’s busiest economic hubs. duan would witness more pivotal events. in 1997  he traveled to hong kong and watched amid heavy rain as the union jack was lowered just after midnight on 1 july  marking the city’s handover from british control to chinese. today  he lives in an apartment on the 14th floor  a far cry from his childhood home in chengdu  surrounded by fields  with no high-rise buildings in sight. the pace of change is sometimes disorienting to him. “my generation  is the one that has been through the agricultural age  the industrial age  and now the internet age ” he says. as he thinks about his country’s future  he has started to think more about the protests he witnessed in 1989. “looking back  it has had a long-lasting effect. it’s like a seed that keeps growing ” he says. “the 1980s was china’s renaissance ” he says. “now  it’s harder. right now  we are in a period of transition. what we need is time for the seed to grow. “it’s a seed that needs proper soil and the right climate  then it can grow and develop. western countries were born into democracy and freedom   if we also want that in china we need the right environment. “the way people are governed is too strict. i don’t think it will last forever.” “they don’t want to solve the problem” – (2000s and beyond) xiao chen  a student at peking university in beijing  represents many of the ideals his country was founded upon 70 years ago. the son of uneducated workers in china’s rural interior  his primary goal is to give back to his country  help elevate the cause of workers and aid china’s progress toward true socialism. he had seen rural poverty – in his village  there was little else to do but drink and gamble. some were taken in by pyramid schemes promising quick money. other young people had few opportunities to get out of the cycle. so he studied  helped by relatives when his parents were not around  and managed to get into the top university in the country. “when i saw the pain of the people around me and my own family  i was eager to change this reality. i thought there could be some simple sense of justice and responsibility ” he says. “i wanted to cultivate myself  and contribute to the country  to serve the motherland and the people.” but chen was soon disappointed after arriving in the capital. he immediately joined the marxist society at the university  eager to implement the tenets he had studied for years in school. he and other members of the group helped workers on campus defend their rights  for the minimum wage and overtime pay  insurance and other protections. soon school officials and the police tried to stop their efforts. many of the students have been detained  grabbed in broad daylight. one was detained while on his way to attend the celebration of mao’s birthday last december. chen  who is using an alias  says he and all the other student members are under strict surveillance. “i really didn’t understand before i went to college. i was confused by the official description. i thought that the policy was to help the people  that the state protects the interests of the people.” chen says he now understands. “i have seen the true face of the teachers  government officials  trade unions  police  and the courts. they don’t care about the workers. “they don’t want to solve problems. they just want to solve the people who reflect the problem ” he says. he can’t leave campus without permission. his relatives back home have had to cut off contact with him. minders are always within 10 metres of him  monitoring him with a camera  even when he is eating at school cafeterias. when he turns on his phone  he immediately gets a phone call or a message from local security  just checking up on him. chen believes there are many more young chinese who agree with them  who have “seen the inequality the country’s fast economic development has created”. “what we have experienced in this generation is a polarised chinese society. when we were young  the countryside was stagnant. there was no development  and the big cities were developing fast.” but chen is quick to stop comparisons between student activists like himself and previous generations who called for democracy and other freedoms  such as the student protesters of 1989  many of them also from peking university. “we do not discuss 4 june because we understand the patriotism and feelings of students  but we do not support their thoughts and behaviours ” he says. but he believes the student movement today is not dead. “i believe that the future must belong to the chinese working class and progressive youth. they will definitely be more and more.” lillian yang contributed additional reporting", "chaos  hope  change:

41876, "world 2019 may 28 edward-seaga-obituary", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/28/edward-seaga-obituary", "peter mason", "one of the most enduring images of modern jamaica  captured in many photographs and on video  is of the moment in 1978 when the reggae musician bob marley persuaded the country’s two warring political heavyweights  edward seaga and michael manley  to hold hands on stage during his one love concert at the national stadium in kingston. seaga  who has died aged 89  looked as uneasy as manley at having to take part in such a gesture of rapprochement. but  like his opponent  he tried hard to force a smile and to go with the moment. marley was  after all  a hugely influential figure in jamaica and was at least attempting to put a stop to the terrible gun violence that had lately been fuelled by the two men’s bitter struggle for political supremacy. for a time the marley-inspired hand-holding had its intended effect  and the political killings slowed down. but only when seaga won power from manley two years later did the country manage a return to anything like its normal balance. seaga’s election as prime minister in 1980 marked a critical moment in the island’s history; one that broke the left-leaning consensus of its post-independence politics and set the country on a more conservative path that gained the approval of allies such as ronald reagan and margaret thatcher. seaga’s jamaica labour party (jlp)  which had originally emerged from the island’s trade union movement  had been part of that consensus until he took over as its leader. with manley’s people’s national party (pnp) intent on a steadfastly non-aligned socialist course  seaga decided that the country must make a rightward shift under his leadership. as soon as he became prime minister he pursued a domestic agenda of privatisation and deregulation  while in foreign policy he realigned jamaica firmly with the west  including through support for the us invasion of grenada and the severing of links with cuba. by the time seaga lost power in 1989 he had changed the local landscape to such a degree that even the pnp was unwilling to return to the leftist ground it had once occupied. but many of those in the electorate who had overwhelmingly supported the jlp’s new direction in the 1980s came to feel that at best his policies had made little difference to the country’s fortunes  and at worst had exacerbated already yawning inequalities across the nation. while he continued with the jlp as leader of the opposition until 2005  he was unable to become prime minister again. seaga was born in boston  massachusetts  where his wealthy jamaican parents  philip seaga  a businessman of lebanese descent  and his wife  erna (nee maxwell)  of mixed european and african heritage  had been living at the time of his birth. when their son was three months old they returned to jamaica  where edward attended the wolmer’s boys’ school in kingston before returning to the us to study at harvard university  gaining a degree in social sciences in 1952. on returning to jamaica in 1955 he did anthropological research and oversaw the recording of an album of the island’s music on the folkways label. that led him to produce more commercially minded recording sessions by local artists for other companies  and in 1959 he set up his own label  west indies recording limited (wirl)  which kickstarted the early 1960s boom in home-grown ska music. in tandem with his business ventures  seaga had also begun a political career in 1959 when sir alexander bustamante  the trade union leader and founder of the jlp  appointed him at the age of 29 to serve as a jlp representative on the legislative council  a body charged with establishing a framework for jamaican independence from britain. when self-rule finally came in 1962  he was elected a jlp member of parliament for the western kingston constituency as his party won a majority in the new parliament. by then other jamaican musical entrepreneurs such as clement dodd were taking the ska revolution a step further and seaga  now consumed by political duties as a cabinet minister responsible for development and welfare  decided to sell wirl to the musician byron lee. he did  however  remain a champion of jamaican music  and one of his first acts as a minister was to arrange for ska artists such as prince buster and peter tosh to appear at a world fair in new york. when the jlp were returned to power in 1967  seaga was promoted to become minister of finance and planning  in which role he set up the jamaica stock exchange and created jamaica citizens bank  the first jamaican majority-owned commercial bank. manley and the pnp won the 1972 election  and two years later seaga became jlp leader. he proved to be a trenchant critic of manley’s commitment to what the jlp often termed “communist” programmes  including nationalisation  the introduction of a minimum wage  social housing projects  land reforms and a closer friendship with cuba. the arguments between the two became so polarised across the pnp’s two terms from 1972 to 1980 that the political conflict began to manifest itself in an upsurge of street violence between armed gangs loyal to each party  with allegations from pnp supporters that the cia was stirring up trouble on the jlp’s behalf. gunfights raged with frightening regularity and many hundreds died. in 1976 the general election was conducted in a state of national emergency and even after the intervention in 1978 of marley  who had himself survived an assassin’s bullet  the situation remained dire. during 1980  more than 800 people were killed as a result of political violence – on an island with a population of just over 2 million. manley had gambled by calling an early election that year. but his charismatic appeal to the electorate had waned dramatically in the face of high inflation and large scale unemployment  allied to a borrowing agreement with the international monetary fund in 1978 that had curtailed his room for action. voters were asked to choose between what the jamaica gleaner characterised as “manley the consummate socialist and seaga the avowed capitalist”. the result was a 51-9 seat landslide for seaga  whose election slogan had been “deliverance is near”. rather suspiciously for some observers  the violence quickly receded after seaga’s victory. as public order was restored and a healing process began  seaga  who always maintained that his pro-market policies had the welfare of poor people at heart  embarked on a programme to reverse much of manley’s work  including through privatisation  the loosening of exchange controls  a dismantling of some social programmes  and tax breaks for foreign investors. he also swung jamaica firmly into the us camp  taking advantage of generous amounts of aid released by reagan  who embraced seaga as a capitalist beacon in a rather suspect caribbean sea. when a revolution in grenada prompted the us invasion in 1983  seaga swiftly provided support from jamaican troops and then called a snap election – two years early – to capitalise on any popularity he might have gained from the move. manley and the pnp  outraged that electoral rolls had not even been updated  refused to contest the elections  and while some minor parties stood in six of the seats  the rest were walkovers. the jlp won all 60 constituencies on a turnout of just 2.7%  ushering in a period of one-party government that dented jamaica’s democratic credentials. a workaholic who was reluctant to delegate responsibility  seaga used his unassailable position to take on a huge portfolio that added the finance and defence briefs to his prime ministerial duties. but his one-man show made little headway against poverty and unemployment  and in the long run he was as unable as manley to get a grip on the debt-ridden economy. in 1989 the jamaican people  tired of the journey he had taken them on – and angry at what they saw as an incompetent response to the ravages of hurricane gilbert in 1988 – returned the pnp to government. seaga failed to win another election over the next decade or so  but he took some comfort from the fact that his nine years in power had forced first manley and then his pnp successors to adopt a more moderate approach both in opposition and in office. thereafter jamaican politicians at least found it easier to locate some kind of middle ground. under seaga the jlp lost heavily in the 1993 and 1997 elections  then more marginally in 2002  by which time his retention of the leadership position after more than 30 years had become an issue within the party. the last of jamaica’s founding political fathers  a generation with forceful personalities and combative outlooks  he stepped down both as jlp leader and an mp in 2005. two years later his jlp successor  bruce golding  was elected as prime minister at the first time of asking in the 2007 election. in retirement seaga settled down to write two lengthy volumes of political memoirs and to further nurture his interest in jamaican folklore  including through an honorary research position with the university of west indies. he was twice married: in 1965 to mitsy (marie) constantine  a former television presenter and miss jamaica  from whom he was divorced in 1995  and then to carla vendryes  a sociology researcher  in 1996. he is survived by carla  by their daughter  gabrielle  and by three children from his first marriage

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/28/saudi-arabia-accused-of-hacking-london-based-dissident-ghanem-almasarir", "stephanie kirchgaessner";"nick hopkins", "saudi arabia has been accused of launching a sophisticated hacking attack against a prominent dissident in london who is allegedly living under police protection  according to a letter of claim that has been sent to the kingdom and seen by the guardian. the letter of claim  which was delivered to the saudi embassy in london on tuesday  was sent on behalf of the saudi satirist ghanem almasarir  and alleges he was targeted by saudi arabia with malware developed by the nso group  the controversial israeli surveillance company. nso’s pegasus software has allegedly been used by saudi arabia and other governments to target journalists  human rights campaigners and political activists. a report earlier this month found that the spyware had previously taken advantage of a glitch on whatsapp to try to gain access to a phone used by a british lawyer involved in a civil case against nso group. according to the letter of claim  almasarir received suspicious text messages in june 2018. these were tracked by independent experts to a pegasus operator who was “focused on saudi arabia” and were linked to a separate attack against another saudi critic. the letter of claim alleges that certain indicators on almasarir’s two apple iphones  coupled with the fact that he had clicked on corrupt weblinks sent to him  as well as saudi arabia’s widely reported use of pegasus  led to the “inevitable conclusion” that the kingdom was responsible for sending almasarir the texts and for the infection of his devices. “a vast amount of mr almasarir’s private information was stored and communicated on his iphones … this included information relating to his personal life  his family  his relationships  his health  his finances  and private matters relating to his work promoting human rights in saudi arabia ” the letter of claim said. the saudi government has six weeks to respond to the letter of claim  which a lawyer for almasarir said could give the saudis a chance to settle before the allegations are formally taken to court. “we use the space of freedom in the west  in europe and america and the saudis want to take this freedom away from us by making me and others feeling like we are living in prison ” almasarir told the guardian. the allegations rely in part on analysis conducted by citizen lab at the university of toronto’s munk school  a research laboratory that focuses on information security and has closely tracked nso and pegasus. the saudi embassy in london and a spokesman for the saudi embassy in washington did not reply to requests for comment on the allegations contained in the letter of claim. nso has previously defended its work. after the revelations about its alleged exploitation of a whatsapp vulnerability to access users’ devices  it said it licensed and authorised governments to use its technology to fight “crime and terror”  but did not operate the system or determine how the technology was used by authorised government agencies. the new allegation comes as other critics of the saudi government – one in norway and one in canada – have been warned by local authorities that unspecified threats have been made against them by the kingdom. saudi arabia has declined to comment on previous reports of alleged threats to the dissidents. saudi arabia faced international condemnation after the murder last october of the washington post journalist jamal khashoggi  a critic who lived in the us and was killed and dismembered inside the saudi consulate in istanbul. us intelligence agencies have concluded with a medium to high degree of confidence that the killing was ordered by the saudi crown prince  mohammed bin salman. a close confidante of the prince  saud al-qahtani  is under sanctions in the us for his alleged role in planning the murder. the almasarir claim  as well as emerging reports of other alleged threats  suggest a new campaign is potentially being waged by the saudi government against critics abroad. almasarir  who has lived in london since 2003  is known as a sharp-tongued critic of the saudi royal family with more than 400000 followers on twitter. he has said his youtube channel  the ghanem show  which has received 230m views  is meant to increase awareness of saudi’s human rights record and poke fun at the royal family. the letter of claim describes allegations of intimidation  including twitter campaigns against him that are said to have promoted violence  as well as attempts over the years to lure him back to saudi arabia or to travel outside the uk. the saudi embassies in london and washington did not respond to allegations of an intimidation campaign. according to the letter of claim  almasarir has been living under police protection in london since 31 october. the guardian could not independently verify almasarir’s account. the metropolitan police in london said it could not confirm or deny whether almasarir was under police protection because it does not discuss matters of security. a canadian-based saudi dissident  omar abdulaziz  has filed a lawsuit in israel claiming nso software was used to target his phone in 2018  at a time when he was in regular contact with khashoggi. abdulaziz has also recently been made aware by local canadian security officials of a possible threat against him  according to a report in time magazine that cited his friends and associates. the nso group has said in response to the legal claim in israel that its products were licensed for governments to “lawfully fight terrorism and crime” and that it did not tolerate “misuse” of its products. the guardian reported earlier this month that another critic  i̇yad el-baghdadi  who has received asylum protection in norway  was recently made aware of an unspecified threat against him emanating from saudi arabia. the warning was passed on by norwegian authorities but originated with the us central intelligence agency. the letter of claim by almasarir alleges he suffered personal injury as a result of saudi arabia’s alleged campaign against him. his law firm  leigh day  is seeking unspecified damages  a public apology from saudi arabia  full saudi disclosure about individuals who acted on its behalf  a return of allegedly stolen information  and costs.", "saudi arabia accused of hacking london-based dissident", "2019-05-28t18:00:19z", "saudi

41880, "world 2019 may 28 david-paintin-obituary", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/28/david-paintin-obituary", "ann furedi";"kate paterson", "david paintin  who has died aged 88  will be remembered for his important work to achieve a liberal abortion law. a doctor and lecturer in obstetrics and gynaecology at st mary’s hospital  london  david also helped to develop current abortion services  including use of the abortion pill  in this country. a quiet man of excessive modesty  david was nevertheless a stubborn and resolute advocate with great foresight. in the 1960s  he was a medical adviser to the formidable team of women who led the abortion law reform association (alra) in its campaign to legalise abortion. his clinical arguments that legal abortion was of benefit to both women and society were central in convincing the liberal mp david steel (now lord steel of aikwood) to introduce the bill that became the abortion act of 1967. prior to this  abortion was available only to preserve a woman’s life  but as there was no clear definition of those grounds  doctors were at risk of prosecution for providing it. as a consequence  most abortions were only performed privately  or illegally  resulting in loss of life or damage to health. the act  liberal for its time  clarified that abortion could be provided when it was in the best interests of the woman’s physical or mental health  or that of her existing children. crucially  and of particular importance to david  was that the legislation  which applied to england  scotland and wales  allowed social circumstances to be taken into consideration. the act  which stipulated that two doctors must agree on one of the grounds for abortion  was carefully worded to allow flexibility in interpretation. for example  it allowed doctors to approve any abortion if they considered that compelling a woman to have an unwanted child would negatively affect her mental health. most did  but some did not. while some doctors considered a woman with four children as a legitimate candidate for abortion  others saw it as evidence that she was a good mother who could cope. david came to the conclusion that women should be trusted to make their own decisions about pregnancy  whatever their age or background. because of this  he continued to press for legal reforms and medical improvements that would place abortion in women’s hands. the abortion pill  which enables women to avoid a procedure at a clinic or hospital  and allows for an early abortion  was initially dismissed by british providers as impractical when it was first licensed in france in 1988. it was david  with dilys cossey  his long-term collaborator from alra and the then director of the birth control trust  who organised the first national meetings  in 1989 and 1993  to educate doctors on the abortion drug mifepristone  which was licensed in the uk in 1991. david continued to monitor the implementation of the abortion act and contributed to resisting the many attempts to restrict it  through his advice to government. he also supported the campaign for legal abortion in northern ireland and the current campaign to decriminalise abortion completely in the uk. he saw his relationship to a woman as her doctor  not her conscience or moral instructor. the woman  he said  not the doctor  lives with the consequences. born in oxenhope  west yorkshire  to bernard paintin  a methodist minister  and kathleen (nee leech)  david went to bridlington grammar school  then  after a family move  to andover grammar school in hampshire. his decision to study medicine was based on his commitment to a life of public service in the “new” nhs. he was a strong opponent of the commercialisation of the national health service and never practised privately. he qualified as a doctor at bristol university in 1954  then did his postgraduate training in obstetrics and gynaecology at aberdeen university  where he was influenced by dugald baird. baird had studied the influence of socioeconomic deprivation on women’s health  and as a consequence had decided that abortion and sterilisation should be available to all. david provided abortions with baird and was impressed by the demonstrated reduction in family size and infant death compared to other major scottish cities. in 1963 david moved to st mary’s hospital in paddington  west london  where he worked in the academic department  teaching undergraduates in obstetrics and gynaecology. he also provided abortions at the hospital  both before and after the act was passed  and in the 80s was able to combine this with the established family planning service at raymede clinic  west kensington  to provide an integrated community abortion service with teaching  counselling and continuity of contraceptive care  one of the first of its kind in the country. accuracy mattered to david. it was important to him that everything about abortion  whether it was the history  the law  clinical practice or the reason why it is necessary was told truthfully without sensationalism or sentimentality. he was editor of the british journal of obstetrics &amp; gynaecology from 1988 to 1992  and held the journal to these standards in the face of nudges to be more commercial. he retired from clinical practice and teaching in 1991  when he became emeritus reader in obstetrics and gynaecology at the university of london. the medical abortion unit at st mary’s was named the paintin unit in his honour in the mid-90s. he was a trustee of the birth control trust from 1973  and chairman from 1981 to 1998. he was also a trustee of the pregnancy advisory service (1981–96) and british pregnancy advisory service (1996-2003); and a trustee and board member of brook (1996-2003)  and chair of its medical advisory committee (1996-98). david is survived by his wife  avril (nee reed)  a doctor  whom he married in 1958  and described as his “essential other half”  and his two daughters  sarah and anne. • david bernard paintin  gynaecologist and campaigner for women’s reproductive rights  born 18 december 1930; died 30 march 2019", "david

"jennifer rankin", "european leaders will meet on tuesday to launch the process for divvying up the european union’s top jobs. at the end of this year  five big jobs fall vacant. the eu will need a replacement for jean-claude juncker as president of the european commission  and donald tusk  president of the european council. the eu also needs new presidents at the european central bank and the european parliament  and a new foreign policy high representative – a post currently held by italy’s federica mogherini. eu appointments are always a fiendishly difficult political rubik’s cube. the bloc wants a spread of leaders balancing west and east  men and women  right  left and centre. adding to the complexity  the european parliament has insisted it should have the biggest say over who leads the european commission. each political group has its own lead candidate  or spitzenkandidat. but eu leaders  who have the right under european law to propose a commission president  mostly oppose what they see as a power grab by the parliament. here are some of the names in the frame to lead the european commission and council. manfred weber although he has been an mep for 15 years and leads the european people’s party group in the parliament  manfred weber is little known beyond brussels. even in his native germany  barely a quarter of people know his name. the softly spoken bavarian mep has been campaigning across the continent in a quest to become european commission president. but french president emmanuel macron opposes his appointment  while many have doubts over his lack of executive experience. unlike previous commission presidents  weber has been neither a government leader nor a national government minister. he is also struggling to win backing from fellow meps. but he is the candidate of german chancellor angela merkel  although she has misgivings about the spitzenkandidaten system that might propel him to office. frans timmermans the chances of the commission’s first vice-president  frans timmermans  getting the top job have improved after social democrats across europe exceeded expectations in last week’s elections  especially in his native netherlands. timmermans  a former foreign minister  who speaks six languages  is best known for his eloquent defence of the rule of law against backsliding from governments in poland  hungary and romania. on the campaign trail he frequently stressed europe’s role in tackling the climate crisis and plastic pollution  including taking a shot at donald trump “and his idiocy on climate change”. he is also seen as a plausible candidate to be eu foreign affairs chief  although faces tough competition from spain’s outgoing foreign minister  josep borrell  as madrid battles for greater influence in the eu. margrethe vestager best known for taking on apple  amazon and google as the eu’s competition tsar  margrethe vestager wants to be the first woman to lead the eu commission. born in zealand  denmark  vestager was the country’s economy minister  pushing through cuts in social benefits  and becoming an inspiration for hit drama borgen. a liberal  she was long thought to be a favourite of macron. but the french president has cooled on her  since she ruled against a merger of france’s alstom and germany’s siemens  a tie-up both governments deemed necessary in the face of chinese competition. michel barnier the eu’s brexit negotiator is not a candidate to become european commission president. not officially. but since the british government signed the brexit withdrawal agreement last november  barnier has been on an eu-wide speaking tour  where he has set out his vision for the continent  touching on issues from air pollution to artificial intelligence. the frenchman had a long political career before becoming embroiled in brexit and backstops. he was european commissioner for the internal market and france’s foreign minister. barnier has “great qualities”  macron said in a recent interview with belgian newspaper le soir that fell just short of an endorsement. for others  he lacks the easy communication style that some think a modern commission president needs. kristalina georgieva the bulgarian economist quit her job as european commission vice president in 2017 to become chief executive officer of the world bank. but some would like her to return to the berlaymont. several eu leaders proposed her name at a recent summit in sibiu  according to bloomberg. georgieva was a well-regarded eu commissioner for humanitarian aid  before becoming commission vice-president  with responsibility for the eu budget. she began her political career at the world bank and has written a textbook on microeconomics. working in her favour  she ticks two important eu boxes: a woman and she is from eastern europe. other possible candidates many eu jobs have gone to unheralded outsiders. no one predicted that labour peer catherine ashton and belgian prime minister herman van rompuy would take newly-created two top jobs in 2009. several names are going round the rumour mill. the long-serving dutch prime minister  mark rutte  is thought to be interested in an eu job. many have speculated over a move to brussels for angela merkel  although she has repeatedly ruled out any eu job. denmark’s former prime minister helle thorning-schmidt

mountaineer has described the “death  carnage and chaos” at the top of mount everest as climbers pushed past bodies to reach the world’s highest summit. the death toll on the mountain grew to 11 in the past day after an american doctor was killed while descending from the peak. it emerged also that an australian climber was discovered unconscious but had survived after being transported downhill on the back of a yak. elia saikaly  a film-maker  reached hillary step  the final stage before the summit  on the morning of 23 may  where he said the sunrise revealed the lifeless body of another climber. with little choice at that altitude but to keep moving  his team – including joyce azzam  the first lebanese woman to climb the world’s “seven summits” – made it to the peak a short time later. “i cannot believe what i saw up there ” saikaly said of the last hours of his climb in a post on instagram. “death. carnage. chaos. lineups. dead bodies on the route and in tents at camp 4. people who i tried to turn back who ended up dying. people being dragged down. walking over bodies. everything you read in the sensational headlines all played out on our summit night.” this year’s everest climbing season is so far the fourth deadliest on record  with mountaineers blaming poor weather  inexperienced climbers and a record number of permits issued by the nepalese government  which  along with a rule that every climber has to be accompanied by a sherpa  led to there being more than 820 people trying to reach the summit. “there were 200-plus climbers making their way to the summit ” saikaly told the guardian of his ascent. “i came across a deceased climber … that person’s body was fixed to an anchor point between two safety lines and every single person that was climbing towards the summit had to step over that human being. “it’s difficult for people at sea-level  who are not mountaineers  who have never been above 8000 metres  to understand that particular scenario. when you are on everest and you’re in the death zone and you can barely think … it becomes a very complicated situation and you realise in your mind that your fate could be the same. and with a line-up pushing you up the mountain there is nothing you can do. you really have no choice but to carry on.” the scene arising from the restricted chance to climb affecting large numbers of mountaineers was captured and widely circulated in a picture taken by nirmal pujra on the morning of 23 may. it showed more than 100 climbers waiting  some for up to 12 hours  for a turn to make the summit. more than 200 people reached the top of the 8848-metre peak that day. chad gaston  another climber who successfully reached the peak  described the difficulty of passing incapacitated people as he ascended  including a man wrapped “like a mummy with ropes tied to him”. he wrote: “the climber was non-responsive and i never saw him open his eyes.” further up he saw a man “holding his chest and bent over”. gaston said: “i waited for a moment and after he didn’t move  i approached him. he said he was having a hard time breathing  even though i saw his oxygen mask was fine. he was in really bad shape  pale faced  not coherent and shaking … i’m sad to say i heard he passed  that night on the mountain.” ten more people have died in the past month while trying to climb other himalayan mountains  bringing the overall death toll to 21. an australian climber was found unconscious on the peak and was identified on tuesday as gilian lee. the canberra man  who survived the 2015 avalanche on the mountain  was attempting it for the fourth time without the use of supplementary oxygen when he was discovered on wednesday by a nepali team  said mingma sherpa  chairman of seven summit treks. a yak carried lee about 1000 metres down the mountain to a vehicle stationed at about 5600 metres. he was flown to hospital in kathmandu and placed in intensive care. lee wrote of his experience in 2015 when the mountain was hit by an avalanche  on 25 april  triggered by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake. “i felt the ground shake  around 20cm lateral movement that unbalanced me inside the tent. we could hear an avalanche starting and it kept building … the biggest wall of vertical snow (guess 50m high of white fluff) was heading right towards us uphill.” the deaths have restarted a debate over whether better regulation is needed for everest  especially on the nepalese side  where 381 climbing permits were issued this year. the number of people seeking to scale everest has exploded in recent years  driven by surges in climbers from india and china. dozens of cut-rate climbing companies have also sprung up in the past 10 years  with some accused of cutting corners or lowering requirements for clients’ fitness and experience levels. alan arnette  an experienced climber and chronicler of the mountain  said that climbers waiting for hours on overcrowded peaks – putting pressure on oxygen supplies – was probably responsible for five of the 21 deaths so far this season; the remainder could have been due to poor training  inexperience  hidden health issues and inadequate support from guides. “it is mainly due to the carelessness of climbers ” said a sherpa. “the government should ensure that prospective climbers should have prior experience of climbing peaks before trying to conquer the mighty mount everest.” saikaly said it may have been his last ascent of the mountain. “i was really turned off this year and i’m just worried ” he said. “i’m really worried for the years ahead of us and what the state of the mountain will be and how much more lives will be lost. “i’m not sure if i’ll head back. i certainly know that as i was climbing up i was certainly doubting whether or not i would ever return.”", "‘walking over bodies’: mountaineers describe carnage on everest", "2019-05-28t13:47:19z", "mount everest";"world

it’s difficult to say  because often there is little information available on these organisations and the churches they own.” a visitor to naples in the 1800s wrote in his diary that “naples has more churches than rome”. in the city’s historic centre alone  there are more than 200 churches  75 of which are completely abandoned. others have become bona fide rubbish dumps. one is the scorziata church  built in 1579  which boasted striking paintings including the san giovannino  an eponymous copy of a painting by caravaggio. the church is closed to the public  and the interior is a heap of debris. its paintings and sculptures have all been stolen. according to the most recent stolen artworks bulletin issued by the carabinieri  in the last year alone  8405 items of archaeological interest have gone missing in italy. despite the abandonment and vandalism  many of these churches continue to attract hundreds of visitors and curiosity seekers  fascinated by the decadent atmosphere they evoke. partially destroyed vaulted ceilings  and altars and pulpits overgrown with vegetation  remind visitors of the exotic temples from indiana jones. armed with his camera  federico limongelli  35  spends his weekends with his friends exploring abandoned churches  asylums  villas and other buildings. in 2015 they created a facebook page titled “tesori abbandonati” (abandoned treasures)  which now has more than 50000 followers. “it started as a hobby ” limongelli said. “these are places that have a certain allure  and telling their stories using photography was also a way to draw attention to their abandonment. many people have begun following us and posting on our page their own explorations of italy’s abandoned treasures. often it was not a question of buildings or churches; sometimes it was entire ghost towns.” the italian national institute of statistics has counted nearly 6000 ghost towns in italy  many of which are medieval villages that succumbed to earthquakes or landslides. some continue to attract visitors and tourists  despite being covered in vegetation. others have ended up on ebay. in 2012  the 25 homes comprising the abandoned medieval village of patraricca  located at the source of the arno river  were auctioned off with a €2.5m opening bid.", "italy's new ruins: heritage sites being lost to neglect and looting", "2019-05-28t11:56:34z", "italy";"archaeology";"europe";"science";"world news";"heritage";"unesco";"culture";"architecture";"art";"art and design";"christianity";"religion"

warren murray opening the road today. the labour party’s disastrous eu election result has finally convinced its leader  jeremy corbyn  to back a second referendum on any brexit deal. paul mason writes: “with a clear position of remain and reform and the call for a second referendum on any deal  labour could have beaten farage’s brexit party … but as at all other times  jeremy corbyn’s advisers saw fit to ignore the evidence.” the lib dem leader  vince cable  says labour voters switched to his party in droves and it could have outpolled the brexit party if remain forces had formed an election pact. on the conservative side  martha gill writes the party may have lost a chunk of voters to remain parties  but “they will hear only one message: they are under threat from nigel farage” and  accordingly  they will lean towards a brexiteer for their next leader. on that front  michael gove has promised free uk citizenship for three million resident eu nationals if he becomes pm and gets brexit through; while jeremy hunt has warned the tories will be annihilated if the next leader goes for a hard brexit and or triggers a general election. both sides of the brexit divide have claimed the eu election results as a victory  but let’s look at this: though nigel farage’s party won big  support for pro-remain parties eclipsed pro-leave parties  and the narrow pro-remain lead is confirmed when conservative and labour votes are factored in (adjusted for the proportions of leavers and remainers in their ranks). remainers won  argues polly toynbee  and would win a second brexit referendum. how are things shaking out on the continent  you ask? the eu’s greens are jubilant after surging to 70 seats in parliament  giving them roughly the same clout as the far-right populists led by italy’s matteo salvini  and a much better chance of using said clout. paris and berlin are at odds over the replacement of jean-claude juncker as european commission president after poor results for the centre-right damaged manfred weber  who was angela merkel’s choice. emmanuel macron’s centrists are licking their wounds in france after running a close second to the far-right national rally party of marine le pen. and in austria  victory for his centre-right party in the eu elections has not proven enough to prevent the ousting of chancellor sebastian kurz  who has just lost a no-confidence vote over a scandal that engulfed his coalition government. plenty more reading at our european elections page. * * * japan mass stabbing – a schoolgirl and a man have been killed

research. “the disadvantages such as air pollution  loss of organic matter and nutrients are less appreciated apparently. removing the material for feed or compost  or added value products such as paper pulp or fuels is often not cost-effective  or no labour is available to do all the work in a short window of time.” but thinking in a different way about “waste products” is essential if we are going to conserve scarce resources and feed a growing population  according to the ellen macarthur foundation. “we need to think about the principles in the past  where we had to do much with little  and at the same time apply the technology we have at hand nowadays to succeed in the challenge of feeding the world ” says clementine schouteden  who leads the global initiative on the circular economy for food at the campaigning organisation. “there’s definitely a sense of urgency in making sure that we farm in a way that is regenerative  preventing waste but also [creating value from] the waste that is currently not edible  with a food industry making the right options for consumers and for the planet.” xilinat’s idea has huge potential  according to sonal shah  the founding executive director of the beeck center for social impact + innovation at georgetown university  and a chivas venture judge. “it’s not just that he’s building a sugar substitute that tastes like sugar but that it’s going to become scalable so every company that uses sugar in its food has the opportunity to rethink what kind of substitute they use ” she said. ebersen added  though  that “you do  however  need a solution for using the leftovers after the xylose has been extracted and the demand for xylitol is small [currently] compared with the amount of residue”. meanwhile  what about javier’s father? “my dad is super-happy ” larragoiti says. “he uses my product every day and he’s willing not to cheat on his diet any more!” • readers have pointed out that xylitol is highly toxic for dogs and even small amounts can be fatal. use with care", "a sweet tale: the son who reinvented sugar to help diabetic dad", "2019-05-28t05:00:07z", "sugar";"sugar";"diabetes";"obesity";"climate change";"mexico";"environment";"americas";"business";"society";"world news"

the replacement of jean-claude juncker as president of the european commission after poor results for the centre-right in the european elections damaged angela merkel’s choice for the post. the german chancellor’s backing for the german mep manfred weber  who leads the european people’s party of which her cdu party is a member  is facing tough resistance from the french president emmanuel macron in the post-election jockeying for top jobs. the eu heads of state and government  including theresa may  are due to meet on tuesday night to kickstart their discussions over the leadership of the bloc’s institutions after a set of election results that weakened the grip of the traditional centrist parties on the levers of power in brussels. the european people’s party (epp) remains the largest in the parliament  but during a disappointing night its haul of seats plummeted from 221 in 2014 to 180  prompting weber to concede that the “centre is shrinking”. the socialists and democrats group’s 191 seats five years ago fell to 145 despite surprisingly strong results in spain and the netherlands  where they topped the polls. it is the first time in 40 years that the two groups are not able to form a stable majority to allow them to carve up the top jobs and set the legislative agenda. the member states choice for commission president also requires endorsement by a majority in the parliament. the big winners on sunday were the greens  up from 50 to 69 seats and the alliance of liberals and democrats group with 109 seats  up from 67 five years ago due to the influx of france’s la république en marche (la rem) and british liberal democrat meps. on sunday night  the greens co-leader  the belgian mep philippe lamberts  said: “to make a stable majority in this parliament the greens are now indispensable.” the epp  however  retains its position as the largest group  prompting annegret kramp-karrenbauer  the leader of merkel’s cdu party  to insist on monday that weber was the “lead candidate and he is our man for european commission president – and we have achieved this goal”. under the so-called spitzenkandidat system  which was used to appoint juncker in 2014  the candidate of the largest party is expected to take the top commission post. but macron  who has long insisted he will not be beholden to that process  instead sought to steal a march on the centre-right on monday by opening talks with the spanish prime minister  pedro sánchez  in an attempt to form a “progressive alliance”. the two men were due to have dinner together in paris on monday evening. sanchez’s ruling socialists came first in sunday’s vote  a result he will likely use to wield more influence in the bloc. the socialist party also scored big in local and regional elections  putting sanchez in a stronger position as he seeks to form a new government following a general election on 28 april. in a joint statement  macron’s la rem and the wider alliance of liberals and democrats political group  said: “the new balance of power in the european parliament calls for a commission president candidate that can build a robust majority way beyond the partisan lines. our new group will be open to consider all candidates that can gather the support of the political families that will compose the future governing majority.” a french government spokesman said: “the group that we are going to join is going to be a swing group which will try to be a driver in the creation of a progressive alliance. why not with the greens?” in a sign of the difficulties in such a proposed deal  the green’s lamberts in turn claimed that macron “couldn’t give a shit” about the environment in the wake of the elections. the european commission’s german secretary-general  martin selmayr  insisted on monday that there was no reason for the main political groups to do anything but follow the spitzenkandidat “lead candidate” process. he admitted that there would need to be “patience” to allow the political groups to find an understanding  adding that he was convinced a replacement for juncker would be found before a new belgian government was formed  a famously difficult process made harder by voters in the national elections over the weekend flocking to both the extreme left and right. sunday night’s election results were also notable for some eye-catching victories for the populist far-right  including marine le pen’s national rally over macron’s la rem in france and the 35% of the vote in italy secured by the league  led by interior minister  matteo salvini. populists failed to win enough seats in spain  the netherlands or germany to make themselves a real threat to the running of the european parliament  but on monday salvini insisted he could build a significant 150-strong bloc of meps. salvini told reporters in milan that he was counting nigel farage’s brexit party and fidesz  led by hungary’s prime minister  viktor orban  to leave their current groups and join the europe of nations and freedom group. the intention is to build on that with a group out of meps from far-right parties in the czech republic  finland  sweden  denmark and spain  “if everyone can overcome jealousies  sympathies and antipathies”  he said. greece’s prime minister  alexis tsipras  was left struggling for his political survival after his syriza party  stung by austerity and a bitter rift over an accord with north macedonia  suffered its first major defeat in years to the opposition conservative new democracy party. smarting from the fallout  tsipras said he would call snap elections  as new democracy promptly demanded his resignation saying he no longer had a popular mandate. by law  the earliest the country could call elections is 30 june.", "macron

mccurry", "donald trump has said he would support shinzo abe’s efforts to act as a mediator between the us and iran  as reports suggested the japanese prime minister would visit tehran next month for talks with the iranian president  hassan rouhani. speaking at a press conference on the penultimate day of his state visit to japan  trump also gave his backing to abe’s attempts to set up a first summit  without preconditions  with the north korean leader  kim jong-un  hours after the regime described the us president’s national security adviser  john bolton  as a warmonger. tehran says it has no interest in talking to the us administration  which has imposed tough sanctions on the country over its nuclear programme and last week sent 1500 troops to the region. “i know that the prime minister and japan have a very good relationship with iran so we’ll see what happens ” trump  who has offered tehran direct talks  told reporters before a working lunch with abe. trump  who became the first world leader to meet japan’s new emperor  naruhito  on monday  added: “the prime minister has already spoken to me about that and i do believe that iran would like to talk. and if they would like to talk  we would like to talk also. we’ll see what happens … nobody wants to see terrible things happen  especially me.” trump later said washington was not interested in regime change in iran. “i’m looking to iran to say no nuclear weapons ” he said. “i think we’ll make a deal. iran has tremendous economic potential … we’re not looking for regime change  we’re looking for no nuclear weapons. i’m not looking to hurt iran at all.” abe said japan “would like to do whatever it can. japan and the us should collaborate closely so that tensions surrounding iran are lessened and do not result in armed conflict”. trump’s conciliatory tone extended to north korea  despite the deadlock in denuclearisation talks and pyongyang’s recent testing of short-range missiles. standing next to abe at the state guest house in tokyo  he said he believed kim was “looking to create a nation that has great strength economically … he’s looking to develop that and he knows that with nuclear weapons that’s not going to happen.” noting that pyongyang had not tested nuclear weapons or long-range missiles since late 2017  trump added: “i’m very happy with the way it’s going.” he said earlier on monday that his relationship with the north korean leader was one of great respect  and talked up the prospect of progress in dismantling the regime’s nuclear weapons programme. north korea responded by calling bolton a warmonger and “defective human product” after he said at the weekend that there was no doubt that pyongyang’s short-range missile tests early this month had violated un security council resolutions. abe agreed with bolton’s assessment  but trump told reporters he was “not personally bothered” by the launches. north korea’s official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed north korean spokesman as saying: “bolton should not be called a security adviser who works to secure security  but an adviser for security destruction who destroys peace and security. it’s best that this defective human product goes away as soon as possible.” abe recently shifted his stance on engagement with north korea  saying he would be willing to meet kim without preconditions  having previously refused to talk unless significant progress was made on resolving the cold war abductions of japanese citizens by north korean agents. “i feel i have to meet face-to-face with chairman kim without attaching any preconditions and exchange frank views with him ” abe said. “president trump … said he would give his full support to that.” on monday  trump met the families of some of the people who were taken to north korea in the 1970s and 80s to teach their language and customs to the regime’s spies. the president  who has raised the issue in his two summits with kim  said he would continue to work to resolve the abductions and end the “unspeakable heartbreak” suffered by their families. emperor naruhito and his wife  empress masako  had earlier welcomed trump and the first lady  melania  to the imperial palace  where the president made a solo inspection of a self-defence force guard of honour and greeted japanese and us officials and politicians. trump said it was a great honour to be the first leader to meet naruhito  who became emperor weeks ago after his father  akihito  became the first japanese monarch to abdicate for 200 years. with the pageantry over  trump and abe held talks in the afternoon. trump said us-japan relations had never been better  but with the allies locked in talks over a bilateral trade deal  he has complained about the “tremendous” trade deficit with japan several times since he arrived on saturday. “i think we will be announcing some things probably in august that will be very good for both countries ” trump said. japan had “been doing much more business with us and we would like to do a little bit more business in the reverse.” japan is desperate to see off trump’s threats to impose high tariffs on its cars and auto parts as part of an effort to reduce trade surpluses with other countries.", "donald trump welcomes japan's offer of mediation with iran", "2019-05-27t05:43:59z", "japan";"donald trump";"asia pacific";"world

"top story: lib dems finish second to brexit party good morning – warren murray here on the morning after the vote that wasn’t supposed to happen. the brexit party and liberal democrats have trounced the conservatives and labour at the european elections  which we are continuing to cover live this morning. the lib dems have undergone a spectacular revival of their fortunes  soaking up pro-remain voters to overtake the tories in theresa may’s maidenhead seat  and placing first in jeremy corbyn’s north london base of islington. overnight  nigel farage’s brexit party won 28 seats  with the lib dems in second on 15 seats. labour held 10  having lost seven; the green party held seven  a gain of four; and the tories were languishing in fifth place with just three seats. the shadow foreign secretary  emily thornberry  said labour must now radically readdress its brexit policy and campaign for a second referendum. the party was wiped off the eu map in scotland. jeremy corbyn promised labour would “reflect on these results on both sides of the brexit divide”. on the continent  the 40-year grip of the two main centrist political groups looked broken as voters turned out in record numbers to bolster radical alternatives. there was not the expected eurosceptic surge but populists were on track to take more seats than ever before. marine le pen’s national rally narrowly beat emmanuel macron’s en marche in france. the greens jumped from 52 meps in 2014 to around 70  almost doubling their result in germany from the previous election to leapfrog the social democratic party (spd) into second place with 22%  exit polls suggested. here are the full eu election results across the uk. the anti-islam candidate tommy robinson (real name stephen yaxley-lennon) won only 2.2% of the vote and snuck out of the election count in central manchester barely an hour after he arrived  claiming he had lost because of a social media ban orchestrated by “the establishment”. * * * hard-brexit hopefuls warned – frontrunners to replace theresa may are being warned that tory mps are prepared to trigger a general election if the next pm backs a no-deal brexit. boris johnson and dominic raab have suggested they would be prepared to crash britain out of the eu  while michael gove and others have signalled they would seek a deal while keeping a hard brexit on the table. gove has described himself as having the “eye for detail” and “conviction” to become prime minister and take britain out of the eu. * * * trump  russia and 2020 – donald trump is not doing enough to ensure the kremlin does not meddle in the the next us elections  experts warn. the covert russian effort in 2016 included fake ads on facebook  russian bots to amplify disinformation  hacking of democratic computers  and agents being sent to the us to collect intelligence and contact trump campaign associates. a bipartisan “secure elections act” that would have bolstered the homeland security department (dhs) has been stymied by republicans in the senate. the dhs is being swamped with work by trump’s fixation on immigration  analysts say – endangering its mission to protect elections from cyber threats. the fbi’s director  christopher wray  recently warned a senate panel that russia remained “focused on sowing divisiveness and discord in this country”. * * * pensioners at work – nearly half a million people are still working at age 70 or over. it translates to one in 12 people aged in their 70s  whereas 10 years ago it was one in 22. “many are actively looking to top up their pension savings while they still can but there is also a growing understanding of the many health and social benefits that come with working into retirement ” said stuart lewis  who finds work and volunteering opportunities for over-50s. but catherine seymour  head of policy at independent age  said it coincided with nearly two million people living in “pensioner poverty”. “many people who are now working in their late sixties and seventies are doing so out of necessity to pay the rent  heat their homes and afford their weekly shop ” she said. stephen clarke from the resolution foundation said people should be allowed to draw on their pension pots while continuing to work. * * * antibiotic alarm – rivers of the world from the thames to the tigris are awash with dangerously high levels of antibiotics  potentially fuelling the immunity of deadly bacteria to the lifesaving drugs. the thames  generally regarded as one of europe’s cleanest rivers  and some of its tributaries are contaminated by a mixture of five antibiotics  the largest global study on the subject has found. the researchers say even low concentrations of antibiotics in the environment can drive the evolution of resistance and increase the likelihood of resistant genes being transferred to bacteria that affect humans. * * * sunshine in a bottle? – no peer-reviewed journal to cite here  but a top uk genetic scientist has declared that people in britain should be taking vitamin d supplements in lieu of getting enough sun. “today  because i knew the sun wasn’t going to shine  i took an extra one ” said professor steve jones from university college london. speaking at the hay festival  he said diseases like rickets were making a comeback  partly because “children today spend an hour a day less outside than they did 10 years ago. that’s the smartphone and the tablet situation.” jones said the benefits of sunshine and vitamin d were felt across health areas from obesity and mood to blood pressure  kidney function and lower risk of multiple sclerosis. “[vitamin d] is really  really important stuff. the evidence that the shortage of sunlight has drastic effects on health is overwhelming.” today in focus podcast: the us crusade against abortion alabama is one of 15 us states that have passed an abortion ban. although none of the bans have come into effect  the aim is to

republicans look to galvanize their base ahead of the 2020 election  a slew of state laws barring access to abortion have thrust the issue into the national spotlight and set up a potential court battle that could hold consequences for an entire generation. top republicans have distanced themselves from a law in alabama that effectively outlaws abortion and includes no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. but the governor of missouri signed a similar bill into law on friday. it bans abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy and also has no rape or incest exemptions. democrats have placed the issue squarely at the center of their agenda  in hope of widening the gender gap between the parties and energizing progressive voters around reproductive rights. with the new laws facing legal challenges that could ultimately land in the supreme court  social issues and the judiciary loom heavily in a campaign season that has so far has centered on the economy and the character of president donald trump. “the last few days of unprecedented energy against abortion bans sent a signal that women everywhere are watching all of this with eyes wide open ” said amanda thayer  deputy national communications director of naral pro-choice america  a group on the front line of the fight. “this anti-choice movement is trump’s anti-choice movement  and it’s clear that the radical fringe is winning any internal argument about how far to push.” for republicans  the alabama and missouri abortion laws reopened debate over the party’s position on abortion and the extent to which conservatives wish to limit access. trump appeared to suggest the republican-controlled alabama legislature had gone too far  tweeting: “i am strongly pro-life  with the three exceptions – rape  incest and protecting the life of the mother – the same position taken by ronald reagan”. those sentiments were echoed by mitch mcconnell and kevin mccarthy  the top republican leaders in congress. but republicans lost the women’s vote by 19% in november’s midterm elections  enabling democrats to take the house and flip several state legislatures. two-thirds of women younger than 30 cast their ballots for democrats. independent women voted for democratic house candidates by 56% to 39%. accordingly  democrats have rallied pro-choice activists with an eye on boosting turnout among women as they seek to limit trump to a single term and make new gains in congress and the states. candidates for the democratic presidential nomination have forcefully condemned the laws in alabama  missouri and elsewhere  raising the specter of a challenge to roe v wade  the 1973 supreme court ruling that legalized abortion in the us. new york senator kirsten gillibrand said she would impose a rare litmus test on supreme court appointments  vowing to only nominate justices who would commit to upholding roe v wade. new jersey senator cory booker said he would establish a white house office of reproductive freedom. california senator kamala harris has raised more than $160000 for pro-choice groups. according to the pew research center  public opinion in favor of legal abortion has remained steady over two decades. republicans have focused messaging efforts on late-term abortions  which are unpopular with the public but account for roughly 1.3% of all abortions in the us. bill kristol  a conservative commentator who has served in multiple republican administrations  said the party had long focused on being “pro-saving more children  not punishing mothers or women in general”. “that incremental  cautious approach has worked both substantively and politically ” kristol said. “i think intelligent  pro-life leaders and advocates are really appalled by what’s happening in alabama and elsewhere. “it undoes a lot of hard work to try to make the pro-life case in a way that’s sympathetic. they’ve just made abortion look like an extremist position and an uncaring position.” ‘the right to choose is unquestionably at risk’ attempts by democrats to brand republicans as “extreme” on abortion are reminiscent of the 2012 presidential election  when incendiary rhetoric at the state level rose to the national discourse – with devastating consequences for the gop. attempting to explain his opposition to any abortion exceptions  todd akin  the republican candidate for senate in missouri  infamously declared that it was rare for a woman to become pregnant through “legitimate rape”. prominent republicans including nominee mitt romney called on akin to quit. but his comments damaged the party’s standing among voters and even inspired the party to conduct training sessions on how to talk to women. “how we talk about these issues is really important ” said alex conant  a republican strategist who advised florida senator marco rubio in his run for the 2016 presidential nomination. “being insensitive to women who are considering an abortion or to women who have had abortions is the wrong approach.” controversy over the laws in alabama and missouri has thus far had less to do with rhetoric than the intended goal of such laws: forcing the supreme court to revisit the issue. democrats  who have long struggled to mobilize voters around matters concerning the federal judiciary  are publicly sounding the alarm over the prospects of the supreme court overturning roe v wade. that has been made more likely  they argue  by trump’s two appointments to the bench  neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh  conservatives who have shifted the court to the right. while some legal experts have cast doubt over whether the supreme court would ever overturn roe v wade in its entirety  others argue that the conservative justices will chip away at abortion rights to the point where it will become nearly impossible to access in certain parts of the country. “the right to choose an abortion is unquestionably at risk with the new conservative majority on the supreme court ” said elizabeth wydra  president of the progressive-leaning constitutional accountability center. “just because the threat to the right to choose might come through a series of rulings chipping away at the reproductive rights rather than a flat out reversal of roe  doesn’t make the threat any less serious. “it is possible to limit access to abortion or burden the right to choose to such an extent that the abortion right exists more in theory than practice.”", "abortion: democrats and republicans whip up voters on extreme state laws", "2019-05-27t05:00:37z", "abortion";"protest";"us constitution and

(it’s now up to more than 4m.) “everybody on youtube writes ‘they’re such idiots’ and ‘why do this?’ but people are watching it and that means they must need it. they write negatively about it but they keep watching it.” the clip fits neatly into a niche that may best be described as “bizarre videos from russia”  a surprisingly productive subcategory of youtube and instagram content perhaps best exemplified by the account look at this russian. that account  which has 387000 followers  featured a video with kamotsky from the slapping championships shortly after his victory. but the idea for the competition itself appears to have been imported from america. organisers of the siberian power show apparently took inspiration from a previous event in moscow  whose organisers in turn had seen something similar online. since at least 2015  an american trade show for tattoo enthusiasts  ink masters  has featured a “slap off”  which also features men being knocked out in raucous competitions. competitive slapping had even earlier been tipped as a kind of joke. a fox sports commercial in the us in the early 2000s referred to the khabarovsk slapping championships as an example of an obscure sporting event that would not interest potential customers. “sports news from the only region that you care about” was the slogan for the channel  as musclebound men slapped each other in the background. the sport now has referees and smelling salts to help bring recipients of the attacks back to full consciousness. kamotsky  who won 30000 roubles  or £350  said he was not sure whether he would take part again. “it feels like it’s taking away from everything else about the event ” he said  referring to the siberian power show. “there are plenty [of events at the power show]  but everyone has just been asking about the slapping.”", "'a show  not a sport': russian face-slapping champion becomes youtube star", "2019-05-26t14:49:07z", "russia";"world news";"europe"

[marineland] took a gamble. they opened it for the first time in years ” he said. marineland has increasingly become a target for activists  who argue the park has a moral responsibility to release the animals it keeps in captivity. the park dismissed protests outside its gates over the opening weekend as a “small group of annual demonstrators [who] continue to seek to damage marineland at all costs”. the park was the focus of a 2012 investigation by the toronto star  which interviewed a number of employees alleging incidences of animal neglect. the park is contesting the claims. “marineland is in what can only be described as a significantly worse condition than when i spoke out in 2012. there has been exactly no investment in improvement to the animal life support systems whatsoever ” said demers. marineland has vigorously denied the claims and has been in a legal battle with demers over the last seven years  alleging he attempted to steal a walrus – an allegation he calls “absurd”. despite pressure from critics  the park continues to house an estimated 51 beluga whales. it also has five bottle-nosed dolphins and a single orca named kiska. proposed legislation in the canadian parliament – dubbed the “free willy bill”– is likely to receive royal assent in the coming weeks and would ban the captivity of cetaceans  including orcas  dolphins and beluga whales across the country. the province of ontario previously passed similar legislation  which banned the acquisition of large marine mammals  but allowed marineland to keep its whales. ever since the park’s owner  john holer  died last year  the company – holer family amusements – has been at a “crossroads”  the niagara falls mayor  jim diodati  told the toronto star  as it explores a possible expansion of the park  or sale of its land to developers.", "calls for canadian zoo to be shut down after deer die in stampede", "2019-05-26t14:28:20z", "canada";"americas";"world news";"animals";"animal welfare";"zoos"

bracing for the appellation he has always dreaded: convicted murderer. a court in paris is due to try the english former journalist this week for the 1996 murder of the french film-maker sophie toscan du plantier in west cork  a bucolic atlantic region known as the irish riviera. “they’re going to bonfire me ” said bailey. “the tectonic plates of my life … are likely to shift horribly and hugely and cataclysmically because i’ll almost certainly be convicted.” the trial – which he will not attend – is the latest twist in a cold case that has bewitched ireland and a global audience of podcast listeners. soon after toscan du plantier’s battered body was found outside her holiday cottage on 23 december 1996  irish police identified bailey  who lived nearby  as the prime suspect. the protracted  bungled investigation turned into a soap opera that remains unresolved: irish prosecutors decided there was insufficient evidence to charge bailey but many people – including french authorities – remain convinced he did it. “it feels like medieval torture. i didn’t do it. i had nothing to do with it ” bailey  62  told the guardian in an interview this week at his cottage in lissacaha. “in paris all they’ll do is convict an innocent man.” under french law a person suspected of murdering a french citizen in another jurisdiction can be tried in france. three judges will rule on the case. for the family of toscan du plantier  who was 39 when she was bludgeoned to death  a conviction will be long overdue and pave the way to potential extradition. her son  pierre-louis baudey vignaud  visited west cork last week to urge witnesses to testify at the trial. “my mother  sophie  is not a ghost  she is the victim of human cruelty and violence which has no place here ” he said in a public appeal. “sophie fought like a lioness against the most atrocious violence there is … i can’t bear the thought of her blood seeping into your soil.” bailey’s lawyer  frank buttimer  said french authorities were transplanting a discredited garda investigation to paris with no new evidence. “it’s a show trial. a rubber-stamping exercise in determining his guilt. they can read into the record statements that were taken many years ago  including many that are discredited or downright bullshit.” french authorities issued a european arrest warrant for bailey in 2010. irish courts twice rejected his extradition  citing flaws in french requests. a conviction in paris could let french authorities try again and possibly succeed  said buttimer. bailey is protected in ireland  for now  but faces arrest and possible extradition if he leaves the jurisdiction. this deterred him attending his mother’s funeral in england. “he’s a prisoner here ” said buttimer. bailey is a polarising figure. considered by some to be a brute  pitied by others as a victim of persecution  it is an oj simpson style of celebrity. he ekes out a living by selling self-published poems and making pizzas that he sells at a weekly market. “i’ve just got to stay calm ” he said. “if i do go down i’ll go like nelson at trafalgar  with both barrels smoking.” a risky metaphor  given the circumstances  but bailey is outspoken. in the 1980s  he ran a small news agency in cheltenham that supplied stories to the sunday times  among others  before he drifted out of journalism. he wound up in west cork  a haven for bohemian expatriates  in the early 1990s. he dabbled as a poet and labourer and moved into the home of jules thomas  a welsh woman  who remains his partner. when toscan du plantier was killed  bailey filed scoops about the case to irish newspapers only to become the main suspect. police said he had opportunity  scratch marks and a record of alcohol-fuelled violence against thomas. twice they arrested and freed him. no forensic evidence linked bailey to the scene. a witness who said she saw him out that night recanted her testimony. a british soldier-turned drifter said police plied him with cannabis to get him to spy on bailey. prosecutors excoriated the investigation and refused to prosecute. bailey said he thought the killer was an assassin sent by the victim’s late husband  daniel toscan du plantier  or an irish policeman  also dead  allegedly spotted speeding near the scene in a blue ford fiesta on the night of the murder. neither theory has gained traction. the case has left bailey in limbo – notorious yet never charged. a 13-part podcast titled west cork by two uk producers has shone fresh light on the case  with bailey an enigmatic central character who appears at times to enjoy the attention. the director jim sheridan is making a documentary. “i’ve been filming for four years. we’ve enough footage to do six hours but i think our best route is a feature documentary ” he said. the trial in paris will provide further material for a saga with no apparent end. “my number one priority is protecting my sanity ” said bailey. “i’m actually quite relaxed at the moment. i do the lord’s prayer. i meditate. i find creative outlets.” he sings  recites poetry  makes video diaries and has become a carpenter. woodwork requires zen-like focus  he said  citing as inspiration antonio stradivari  who reputedly made a violin amid warfare in medieval cremona. despite everything  bailey said he was happy in ireland and in no rush to leave. “hopefully i’ll be leaving in a coffin rather than on a plane in handcuffs.”", "'they’re going to bonfire me': french trial for briton over film-maker's death", "2019-05-26t12:41:07z", "ireland";"uk

"peter o’neill  the prime minister of papua new guinea  has resigned after weeks of high-level defections from his ruling party. o’neill told a news conference in port moresby that recent changes to political allegiances in parliament had shown a “need for change”. on friday  o’neill’s opponents said they had mustered enough support in parliament to oust him over a range of grievances including dissatisfaction with o’neill’s leadership and in particular his unilateral handling of a multibillion-dollar gas deal that opponents said was a poor outcome for png. o’neill  who has been prime minister for seven years  has handed the leadership to sir julius chan. chan  79  is a former prime minister of papua new guinea  having served in the top job from 1980 to 1982  as the country’s second ever prime minister  and then again from 1994 to 1997. his second term as prime minister was controversial for his handling of the bougainville civil war. chan’s government took out a contract with a mercenary organisation to crush separatist fighting in bougainville  which led to widespread public protests. bryan kramer  an opposition mp and one of o’neill’s most outspoken critics  told the guardian he considered the announcement a “ploy” from the prime minister to try and win back mps who had defected from the government camp  and that he would not believe o’neill was really leaving the top job until due process had been observed. “he’s announced he has stepped down  but we haven’t seen a resignation letter ” said kramer. the resignation will only come into effect once o’neill has visited the governor general  something o’neill said he would do in the coming days. writer and activist martyn namorong said: “only proof of resignation of a pm is presentation of a letter of resignation to the governor general and not a media announcement.” kramer said o’neill’s announcement was an attempt to pre-empt a vote of no confidence in the prime minister that opposition mps would have called for when parliament resumes on tuesday  which they say they had the numbers to win. after o’neill visits the governor general  the vacancy for the position is announced in parliament  and there will be a vote by mps for a replacement leader. kramer said he was confident the opposition bloc  known as the laguna camp  had the numbers to elect a member of their group to the top job. “assuming the resignation goes through  we will have 63 [mps on their side  compared with the government’s 48 mps]  whoever we decide on as our nominee  which is a decision that hasn’t been made yet  will be the next prime minister ” said kramer. “it will definitely not be julius chan.” “this is png politics  it’s not over yet ” he added. responding to sunday’s events  australian prime minister scott morrison thanked o’neill for his friendship. “i have worked with peter on three different portfolios  as the minister of immigration  as the treasurer  as prime minister. peter has been a passionate servant of his country.” he praised papua new guinea as australia’s closest ally. “we have a special relationship  and always will. and i will look forward to working with the prime minister of png in the same way i have enjoyed such a strong friendship and relationship with peter o’neill. my simple message to peter o’neill  and i look forward to passing this on soon personally  is thank you. thank you on behalf of australia for your friendship.” kramer said that among the opposition’s priorities if one of their mps were elected to the top job were the country’s crumbling health and education systems and improving the economy by stamping out corruption. political instability is something of a fixture in the resource-rich but poor south pacific nation and o’neill has seen off previous attempts to topple him. the political crisis came to a head earlier this month after a spate of high-profile resignations by government ministers led to mps calling a vote of no confidence in the pm. o’neill secured a three-week adjournment designed to stall the no-confidence vote and defended his record  labelling talk of a declining economy and living standards as “fake news”. last week  png politics was again thrown into crisis when the attorney general announced an investigation into the citizenship status of all 111 of the country’s mps to determine if any hold dual citizenship  which would disqualify them from holding public office  after an accusation from kramer that o’neill held both papua new guinean and australian citizenship  though he offered no direct evidence of this. o’neill denied these allegations and presented his png passport  with australian visas inside  to the courts as evidence.", "papua new guinea's prime minister  peter o’neill

journalist robert evans hosts the breakout podcast it could happen here  which canvases scenarios for a new american civil war. he said that the christian right “generate a lot of the extremist language in mainstream politics”  but that “there’s more talk about violent insurrection from the white nationalist right than the christian right  because there’s less faith in politics”. for now  as demonstrated by the abortion bills passed in several states in an apparent attempt to get a case to the supreme court and overturn abortion rights nationally  the christian right is reaping dividends from engaging with the political process. but  evans notes  the danger may come if “they see victory slip from their grasp”. and unlike the fractious and small subcultures of the racist far right  “the christian right is really good at keeping people working together for years at a time”.", "christian rightwingers warn abortion fight could spark us civil war", "2019-05-26t06:00:07z", "abortion";"the far right";"christianity";"us politics";"us news";"women";"health"

(the children’s mother had died a few months earlier.) despite the horror  the document brought a certain relief. there is catharsis in knowing. but i still didn’t understand why my parents had never told me. a few weeks ago i walked with my father and aunt – who were four and eight respectively at the time of the bombing  to the house – rebuilt  of course – where chang used to live. it is not even a 10-minute walk from my father’s place. in front of neusser strasse 3 i asked again: why did you never tell me this? why did you never talk about it in the family? there were  of course  stories i heard as a child. how grandma bolzen wanted to save the laundry from chang’s burning house and my dad stopped her screaming. how my grandfather came back from military service and reopened his carpentry shop on a street down the road from their burned-out home. but my parents never took me to visit the graves of uncle chang’s family. why not? even 75 years later  i got no answer. “maybe our parents talked about it  but never in front of us.” the children  in turn  did not pass anything on to their children. one generation has denied the memory to the next generation. a memory of incredible pain  yes  but one that is worth preserving nonetheless. “history is like a quarry which each generation makes use of ” said dietmar süß  a german historian  when i asked him about my family’s story. “memory is not static; it adapts to the respective political and cultural context.” according to his research  immediately after 1945  german cities that were bombed intensively commemorated the air war and its victims. with the peace movement in the 1970s  germans began to face up to their role as perpetrator  and finding a place for their victimhood became more difficult. in britain  too  the memory of two world wars feeds national identity  but in a very different way. it is the story of the nation that made huge sacrifices and liberated europe from nazi terror. the nation that won the war. but here  too  memory adapts. “remembrance of the second world war in particular is an important component of british national identity ” said historian richard overy. “since 2000 there has been a growth of memorials to its victims and heroes.” today this memory feeds into the brexit debate  for example by perpetuating the “better alone” narrative. “nostalgia for the war avoids modern issues about britain’s role in the world  evoking an apparently glorious and heroic past  when britons bravely confronted (usually) the german threat.” it was on a cold morning earlier this month that an raf guard of honour from 101 squadron stood at the war memorial in mailly-le-camp  north-central france. opposite them was a guard of honour from the french military and  in between  a row of french veterans. they faced families  including ours  who had travelled from the uk  france and germany to remember loved ones  men like arthur  whose bravery brought the end of adolf hitler’s regime. above this very spot 75 years ago  german flak made the starry sky bright as day as 346 lancasters raced through the night  dropping 1500 tons of bombs on a compound where the wehrmacht was training tank units ready for the allied invasion. on 6 june  world leaders will gather in france to remember d-day. but the attack on mailly-le-camp  and many other raids around the time  helped weaken german military defences and infrastructure on french soil. it is a stark illustration of what it had taken to get to that point. on that night in 1944  german night squadrons used the delayed communication between the raf advance party and the lancaster pilots. the nazis knew the weak point of the lancasters: their gunners could defend the planes backwards  forwards and sideways  but not downwards. so the luftwaffe shelled the british from below. of 346 lancaster bombers  42 did not return  one of them arthur’s. “missing – no news since take-off ” was the curt expression in the british command’s operation report. mönchengladbach is mentioned eight times in the 1985 book bomber command war diaries. it was the first place the raf attacked  in may 1940  and its location west of the rhine made it a repeated target. by the end of the war  50% of its centre had been destroyed. ever since i was told of the raid on uncle chang’s house  a horrible possibility had been lurking in my mind: that arthur might have flown over mönchengladbach and unleashed the bombs that devastated my family’s home. after all  records show him involved in a number of raids on german cities  among them berlin  leipzig  stuttgart and schweinfurt. nervously  i waited at the archive counter for the death certificates. my eyes immediately went to the date: 10 september 1944. uncle arthur had been killed four months earlier. he was not involved. i felt relieved  yes. but  more importantly  liberated. arthur’s and chang’s stories have enabled me to reclaim an important part of my family’s history. my past is now less of a foreign country.", "my great uncles' war: how my german-british marriage linked two wartime tragedies", "2019-05-26t06:00:07z", "second world war";"d-day";"germany";"europe";"history books";"world news";"family"

friday  the loudspeaker outside sarai alawardi mosque crackled to life  and more than a thousand foreheads were touched to the hessian mats that lined the ground. towering over them were the skyscrapers of gurgaon  a satellite town south of delhi that houses technology companies  bowling alleys and other symbols of the “new india”. a day after the hindu nationalist prime minister  narendra modi  claimed a landslide election victory  some in the congregation were anxious about whether this new country had a place for them. “these days  it isn’t safe for us here any more ” said haji shezhad khan  the chairman of a local muslim activist group  sitting in a shaded courtyard a few metres from the mosque. for many indian muslims – whose population of about 200 million would comprise the seventh-largest country on earth – modi’s emphatic re-election has been an isolating experience. the country’s most acrimonious election campaign in recent history was studded with references to unauthorised migrants from bangladesh as “termites”  the nomination to parliament of a hindu accused of terrorism and a debate over whether mahatma gandhi’s assassin – who killed the founding father for supposedly cowing to muslim demands – was in fact a patriot. despite this  or perhaps because of it  a record 270 million indians cast their votes for modi’s bharatiya janata party (bjp) or its allies. “we truly believed it would be fought back ” said nazia erum  an author who has written a book about raising a muslim child in today’s india. “we believed that a lot of voting that happened in 2014 was based on modi’s development agenda and people would be able to see through it now and things would be different. and as it turns out we were entirely mistaken.” friction between hindus and muslims  as well as tension among sects within both faiths  has been a persistent feature of indian life. but in the past five years violence against muslims has increased  including at least 36 killings by “cow vigilantes” of cattle farmers and traders accused – usually spuriously – of harming the revered animals. in gurgaon  where hundreds of thousands of muslim migrants have arrived in the past few years along with hindus to work in factories and on construction sites  tension has been boiling over. bitter campaigns have been waged against muslims praying in public spaces because mosques have no capacity or are too far away. sanctioned prayer spaces have been gradually whittled down to just over three dozen after protests by hindu organisations. “they are not allowing us to pray ” said khan. rajeev mittal  the head of a hindu nationalist group that has campaigned against mosques in the area  insists his campaign is strictly about upholding municipal planning laws. “we are not against people offering prayer  but it should be done in the mosque or in all the areas designated for them ” he said. the bjp points to statistics that show there have been no large-scale religious riots under modi’s prime ministership  and no surge in bias crimes in the country’s official data – though some rights groups argue this information is patchy and unreliable. the impact of modi’s rule has been to embolden extremists  his critics say  and create a culture where religious chauvinism and impunity can flourish. “more than riots  muslims fear the pinpricks ” said meenakshi ganguly  the south asia director for human rights watch. “it’s the muslim vegetable vendor who is suddenly beaten up  it’s when muslim families say they are worried about taking lunch boxes because they don’t know when they’re going to be accused of carrying beef. “people feel entitled to impose their voices  and to do so violently  and there is no assurance the state will step in and protect them.” modi’s supporters and opponents alike recognise that his victory on 23 may is the cementing of an ideological shift in what will soon be the world’s most populous country. most elections are a choice between competing visions  but india’s polls this year were  in the words of the congress mp shashi tharoor  “a battle for india’s soul”. in dispute is a century-old argument about the myths that should fuel indian nationalism. the country’s first prime minister  jawaharlal nehru  surveyed the extraordinarily diverse subcontinent and conceived it as a parchment “on which layer upon layer of thought and reverie had been inscribed  and yet no succeeding layer had completely hidden or erased what had been written previously”. opposing him were hindu nationalists such as vinayak savarkar  an atheist but one who viewed hinduism in its innumerable manifestations as a set of cultural practices that bound the subcontinent’s people together as a single nation. his vision left little room for muslims or other minorities. “mohammedan or christian countrymen … are not and cannot be recognised as hindus ” savarkar wrote in a 1923 treatise. “their holy land is far off in arabia or palestine. their mythology and godmen  ideas and heroes are not children of this soil.” the modern hindu nationalist movement has evolved from savarkar’s views  said rajat sethi  a fellow at the india foundation  a thinktank aligned with the right-wing hindu umbrella group  the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss)  of which modi is a lifelong member. “savarkar talks about a more militarised hinduism … the rss would say  no  it’s about culture ” sethi said. “hinduism is a community based on shared culture practices rather than a dogmatic book.” in this way  he said  muslims and christians were also hindus: their lifestyles and rituals also inflected by india’s hindu civilisation. “muslims form an integral part [of the nation] because a lot of what we stand for is incomplete without muslims as a religion.” the ostensibly “secular” politics of nehru’s congress was really a byword for courting muslim votes by giving the community special privileges  he added  such as political autonomy for kashmir  and the right to govern marriages and other social affairs according to islamic law – both of which hindu nationalist groups target for reform. nehru’s vision now appears to be in terminal decline. the hindu nationalism he tried to sideline  including by banning the rss  has been granted a clear popular endorsement. its worst excesses may be borne by the poor  but wealth and privilege are no shield  said erum  who researched her book by interviewing more than a hundred children and their parents at some of the most elite schools. “it’s happening in classrooms  in playgrounds: kids are bullied on religious lines  they are reflecting the fractures in our society ” she said. “it’s happening in the best schools  the most metropolitan cities. this is no longer the fringe.” she blames in part the country’s 24-hour news channels  which  along with social media  fixate on divisive issues that draw eyeballs but promote a vision of a country in perpetual argument. “it is an unending culture war ” she said. “growing up in india was one of the best experiences ” she added. “religion was not a factor you considered when you played or shared tiffins. but now it is.”", "india’s muslims quiver in the new dawn of an emboldened narendra modi", "2019-05-26t05:59:03z", "india";"world news";"south and central asia";"narendra modi";"hinduism";"religion"

if anything  it is pushing the other way. foreign diplomats and analysts describe us policy as confused or non-existent. relations between the sudanese professionals association (spa)  the opposition’s organising force  and the us embassy in khartoum are said to be strained. one opposition official told foreign policy magazine that talking to the americans was “a waste of time”. a meeting in washington earlier this month of western countries  the un and the african union failed to agree a joint course of action. rather than seize the moment  the us (and by default  britain  the former colonial power) has passed the initiative to trump’s hard-faced buddies in saudi arabia  egypt and the uae. these countries backed bashir and are now backing (and financing) attempts to revive the pre-coup status quo under new leadership. sudan’s protesters were clear from the start that the regime  and not just its senior figures  must change. it is this crucial battle they are in danger of losing. this ultra-conservative  nationalist arab axis  marching in ideological lock-step with trump  has its own candidate for sudan’s next strongman. general mohammed hamdan dagalo  known as hemedti  is deputy leader of the transitional military council. he also heads the feared rapid support forces (rsf)  a large paramilitary group that evolved from the janjaweed militia implicated in the darfur genocide. sporadic  lethal attacks on street demonstrators earlier this month were blamed on the rsf. dagalo has easily eclipsed the head of the military council and sudan’s temporary leader  general abdel fattah al-burhan. it was dagalo’s insistence on having an inbuilt majority in a proposed civilian-military power-sharing government that triggered last week’s breakdown in talks with the opposition. and when the spa called a general strike in response  it was dagalo who threatened reprisals. it is unclear what the opposition  split over tactics and running out of steam  can do now. the danger of a descent into violence is real and ever-present. dagalo claims he is not seeking power  but his ambition is obvious. he said last week he was overseeing judicial proceedings against bashir and 25 regime figures detained since the coup – thereby controlling the process and ensuring they pose no threat to the new order. at the end of the week  he personally received the royal seal of approval from trump’s principal arab ally  mohammed bin salman  the saudi crown prince  at a private meeting in jeddah. outsourcing us foreign policy to trump-like “strongmen” and friendly regional proxies is now an established trend. in neighbouring libya’s rekindled civil war  trump backs a renegade general  khalifa haftar  who is also supported by the saudis and uae. likewise  the white house gave a warm welcome to egypt’s president  abdel fatah al-sisi  another instinctive autocrat who hijacked a popular revolution. as in sudan  hopes of root-and-branch reform in algeria  where a figurehead president was forced out last month  are fading amid army machinations and american and european indifference. perhaps it is incorrect to say the us no longer leads by example. a depressingly large number of world leaders now take their cue from trump  aping his regressive  self-serving and adversarial outlook. the totemic american founding vision of “a shining city on a hill”  symbolising a land of freedom and justice  has in the era of trump become a darkly tarnished keep from which to browbeat  exploit – or ignore – the world.", "sudan  algeria  libya: new arab spring stalls as trump looks away", "2019-05-25t18:01:42z", "sudan";"middle east and north africa";"africa";"world news";"trump administration";"us politics";"us news";"egypt"

reading issues from its first decade feels as novel today as it did then. its tone is original  the reportage reads like literature  the style is uncompromising  and the analysis combative. new journalism is often considered to have emerged in new york in the late 1950s. but it could be argued it came from paris in the late 1940s with les temps modernes  which was among the first to break down the divide between literature and journalism. the first issue in october 1945 provoked a big bang in journalism and politics  and not just in france. its manifesto was translated and published widely  including in cyril connolly’s horizon in london. it read: “every writer of bourgeois origin has known the temptation of irresponsibility. i personally hold flaubert personally responsible for the repression that followed the commune because he did not write a line to try to stop it. it was not his business  people will perhaps say. was the calas trial voltaire’s business? was dreyfus’s condemnation zola’s business? we at les temps modernes do not want to miss a beat on the times we live in. our intention is to influence the society we live in. les temps modernes will take sides.” to carry its distinctive voice far and wide  les temps modernes (named after charlie chaplin’s modern times) could rely on a diversity of talented writers and philosophers from across the political spectrum. communists  catholics  gaullists and socialists: philosopher raymond aron  marxist phenomenologist maurice merleau-ponty  anthropologist and art critic michel leiris  and even picasso  who had agreed to design the cover and logo. the british writer philip toynbee contributed a letter from london  while novels and essays the committee particularly liked were serialised prior to their publication or with a view to attracting a potential publisher. les temps modernes was particularly interested in women  foreign writers  dissidents and original voices of talent. its first issue opened with an exclusive extract of the black american writer richard wright’s fire and cloud  whose description of lynch mobs in the deep american south shocked french readers and shed light on racial discrimination in america in lyrical and violent language  superbly translated by marcel duhamel. in the following issues  samuel beckett  violette leduc  nathalie sarraute  boris vian  jean genet and many others found a home at les temps modernes. troubles in indochina and north africa were first reported in les temps modernes and the journal embraced the anti-colonialist cause with passion and courage. a laboratory of new ideas and a talent agency rolled into one  les temps modernes was also existentialism’s incubator. sartre concluded the first issue with an article entitled the end of the war  in which he wrote: “peace is a new beginning but we are living an agony … war has left everyone naked  without illusions; they now can only rely on themselves and this is perhaps the only good thing that has come out of it.” this pessimism stung many readers  but it also felt like a new honesty  one which called for immediate action. there was something fresh  stimulating  liberating in it. responsibility for our actions as much as for our inactions  for our commitment or lack of it  was ours and ours alone. no more excuses. gallimard had agreed to finance the journal and to give the team a small office in the heart of saint-germain-des-prés  at 5 rue sébastien bottin. extraordinarily  sartre committed himself to receiving anyone who asked to see him at the magazine’s office every tuesday and friday afternoon between 5.30 and 7.30. this promise was even printed at the front of the magazine  along with the telephone number littré 28–91  where he could be reached. this was democracy and public debate in action. this led to heated debates and some tragicomic scenes. in her memoirs  de beauvoir recalled abbot gengenbach  a “half-defrocked priest”  who became a regular visitor. “a surrealist  he drank heavily  cursed the church and went out with women. he then locked himself up for a few weeks in a monastery to make amends.” on another tuesday afternoon the receptionist rushed to de beauvoir: a reader whose text had been turned down by the editorial committee had just cut open his wrists. after les temps modernes made its position on abortion clear  advocating its legalisation  people started queuing in front of its office to ask the secretary  madame sorbet  for the details of doctors who would discreetly perform this illegal medical act  which at the time was punishable by life imprisonment  and in some cases even death. modern and dangerous times. les temps modernes inexorably followed the political peregrinations of sartre and de beauvoir. as the cold war froze public discourse into bloc politics for decades  it too sometimes lost itself in leftist obfuscation. it then lacked the clarity of its glorious beginnings  but it is the impact made in those first years that will be its lasting legacy.", "les temps modernes:\r\nparis mourns passing of the intellectual left’s bible", "2019-05-25t13:00:05z", "paris";"jean-paul sartre";"simone de beauvoir";"culture";"media";"france";"europe";"world news"

lucchino  had been left empty since 2009 and had not been bought by either the city council or the regional government. “this is possibly the oldest house in seville ” he says. “this is the house where velázquez was born and the only surviving house in which he lived. and only the facade and the entrance way were protected. but apart from that  if you wanted to turn it into a mcdonald’s or a zara  or a tourist flat or a brothel  you could.” by the time it eventually came on the market last year  bocanegra and his partners had borrowed and scrounged the €1.4m needed to stop it becoming a burger bar  an airbnb or a bordello. “i’d run the numbers and i reckoned that if we had 60000 visitors a year  that would be enough ” he says. “then i went around people i knew in seville with money and told them about the project. i said it wasn’t the usual business venture  but that they wouldn’t lose their money. some ignored me; others were convinced and went on to convince other people.” the plan now is to strip away the modern partitions and begin the long and expensive task of coaxing the building back to life. earlier this month  bocanegra and his partners teamed up with the conservation group hispania nostra to launch a crowdfunding appeal to raise the €50000 needed to repair the roof. if the money comes through  they can begin restoring the house and getting it back to how it would have looked when the young velázquez lived there. furniture  tiles and props will need to be sourced  craftspeople found and audiovisual guides created to build up a picture of seville as it revelled in trade and treasure from the americas. bocanegra  who is aware of the quixotic nature of the endeavour  hopes to have a flexible space for workshops and exhibitions and  naturally  a gift shop. he would also like to see the house play its part in rediscovering and preserving the craft skills of the 16th and 17th centuries. so far  the new owners have had to go it alone. but the culture and heritage department of the andalucían government is ready to help. its forthcoming budget will include funds of almost €2m for private cultural enterprises such as the velázquez house. “the department is also at the service of the house’s owners when it comes to exploring new avenues of collaboration for conserving the property  such as having it declared a building of cultural interest ” it said in a statement to the observer. bocanegra wonders whether andalucía has been slow to embrace velázquez’s legacy because the painter committed the cardinal sin of leaving seville when he was 24. “in seville  velázquez is seen as another of the baroque geniuses  along with bartolomé esteban murillo  juan de valdés leal and juan martínez montañes ” he says. “but  to put it simply  velázquez is the messi of the spanish sevillian baroque dream team. he really is. everyone knows who velázquez is  and las meninas is every bit as much an icon of spanish culture as don quixote or guernica.” the english writer amy sackville – whose last novel  painter to the king  explored velázquez’s life and era – has contributed to the crowdfunding effort and hopes the venture will serve to tether the paintings to the artist and his origins. “i like the idea that it’s going to be a space for education and a space that people can move through and not just a sort of shrine – something that continues to live and be used ” she says. almost 400 years after velázquez’s death  she adds  his paintings still fascinate – and puzzle. “velázquez’s work – and a lot of the artistic and literary production of the time – is very interested in the difference between artifice and reality and the idea of illusion and surface. “i think part of the reason that his work still compels us is that it is representational but also enigmatic  and it asks questions of us as we’re looking at it. it asks us to think where we stand in relation to it across time and across space.” bocanegra has been roaming the house for months and still remains beguiled by the building and its most famous inhabitant. every now and then he looks up from his makeshift desk on the patio to watch the light drift along the walls and corridors. he also wonders whether it was through one of these windows that the painter-to-be glimpsed an elderly neighbour frying eggs  or whether perhaps the waterseller of seville drew his stock from the ancient cistern beneath the floor. “the light in here changes almost by the minute and i can see velázquez here as a young boy  playing in this patio ” he says. “i can see him here very clearly  watching the light as it changes and shifts the shape of things and the distances between them. “he came out of his mother’s womb a genius  but maybe it was here that he watched the light and began his training.”", "the bid to save velázquez’s childhood home inspired by … shakespeare", "2019-05-25t13:00:01z", "spain";"diego velázquez";"art and design";"world news";"painting";"art";"culture"

everest  in a season marred by poor weather and overcrowding on the world’s highest mountain. the death of robin fisher  who reportedly collapsed while returning from the summit  was announced by mira acharya  the director at the nepalese department of tourism. according to acharya  44-year-old fisher died at about 8600 metres (28200ft) after falling ill during his descent. the foreign office is aware of the reports  but has not yet been officially informed of any incident. murari sharma  at everest parivar expedition  the company that had been guiding fisher  said he had been part of a six-member expedition led by dani fuller. “the climbers  along with the sherpa guide  made it to the summit at around 8.30am ” sharma told local media  adding that fisher  along with jangbu sherpa  had complained of illness during the descent. other guides changed fisher’s oxygen bottle and offered him water  but could not save him  sharma said. fisher’s family issued a statement describing how he had previously climbed mont blanc and aconcagua and had “lived life to the full”. “we are deeply saddened by his loss as he still had so many more adventures and dreams to fulfil. every one who ever met him in any capacity will always remember the positive impact he had on their lives.” however  adding to growing criticism of the number of deaths this year  garrett madison of the us-based company madison mountaineering said many of those attempting everest were not “well-qualified or prepared climbers” and lacked the support necessary to ascend and descend safely. “if they were with a strong and experienced team  they would likely have been fine  but with minimal support  once something goes wrong  it’s tough to get back on course ” madison said. concern over crowds on the mountain this year during last week’s brief weather window were underlined by the publication of a picture taken by the former british soldier nirmal “nims” purja showing long queues on the summit slopes. it also emerged that long delays at bottlenecks on the summit ridge – and during the descent – may have contributed to several deaths. the american climber don cash died on wednesday after being delayed in a bottleneck of climbers during his descent. cash  55  fell ill close to the summit and was being helped down by two sherpas when he collapsed again while waiting in a queue for two hours to descend the hillary step  a well-known chokepoint. like cash  the indian mountaineer anjali kulkarni appears to have died during her descent after being caught in the ascending queues. “anjali and her husband were forced to wait for hours to reach the summit as there was a long queue on the slopes of everest ” said thupden sherpa  the head of her trekking company. “the sherpa guides supported her while coming down  but she didn’t make it.” overcrowding and safety have been a growing cause for concern in recent years  not least since the emergence of cut-price nepali trekking companies that

to avoid congestion. this season’s summit crowding – the worst since 2012 – has been exacerbated by unsettled weather that left only five possible summit days in may so far  compared with between seven and 12 in recent years. this had caused hundreds of climbers to converge on several notorious sections where they can pass only one at a time. issues on the popular south col route  on the nepalese side of the mountain  have been growing for years partly due to an unwillingness by nepal’s tourism ministry to tackle a constellation of concerns  including regulating cut-price trekking companies and permit numbers  and vetting potential climbers. alan arnette  who chronicles each everest season in his blog  described the conditions as insane. “in 2019  we are hearing horror stories of summit pushes from the south col to the summit taking 10  12  even 14 hours. and due to the jams  the return to the col is taking up to another six hours  making for 20-hour pushes – that’s insane.” jase wilson  a leeds beckett university researcher at base camp  confirmed that bad weather had meant few ascents before this week’s brief window. “the winds have been relentless so far … this has left around 300 climbers  along with climbing guides making around 600  all heading for the summit during the short lull [this week].” kenton cool  who climbed everest on 16 may for the 14th time while guiding a client  told the guardian there were two overlapping issues: the growing popularity of everest  not least among indian and chinese climbers  and declining levels of experience among those tackling the mountain – once regarded as the preserve of elite mountaineers. “i’m not sure what the answer is. but looking at nims’s picture  no part of that screams fun. i pride myself working one on one and being agile  avoiding queues [to] get up and down safely.” with the increasing number of inexperienced climbers  cool said he saw some kind of capability assessment as a “step in the right direction”. simon lowe  the managing director of uk-based jagged globe  said his firm got a team of 12 to the summit on 23 may after setting off as soon as large numbers appeared at the south col. “the queue this year isn’t the problem ” he said. “but it exacerbates an underlying issue  and that is incompetent climbers being led by incompetent teams. if you go up with a bare minimum of bottles of supplementary oxygen and stand in a queue for ages  that is going to cause problems.” without reforms  lowe  like others  can see guiding on everest for companies like his becoming questionable. “i think i do see a point where it becomes untenable  where it becomes a bit distasteful. and you would have to ask: do we want to be part of it?”", "british climber latest to die on

diddly squat. instead  as one local paper put it last year  they concentrate on “fringe issues and oddball causes that don’t improve alabamians’ lives and health”. doesn’t sound very pro-life  does it? while we’re at it  let’s campaign for universal healthcare the rest of the developed world has accepted that affordable healthcare is a good thing  but the american right still treats the concept of going to the doctor and not ending up in crippling debt as some kind of nefarious communist plot. which is strange  because making it almost impossible for people to get medical help seems kinda anti-life  doesn’t it? just ban guns already even more than the national passion for everybody loves raymond  nothing baffles me more about my fellow americans than the gun obsession. us politicians talk proudly about how they are anti-abortion because “every life is filled with potential” (carly fiorina) and then in the next breath refuse to admit that maybe the reason 30000 americans are killed by guns every year is because of all the goddamn guns. maybe those 30000 lives aren’t filled with potential? or would abortions be fine if the woman did it with a gun? vaccinations according to the world health organisation  10 million lives were saved by vaccinations between 2010 and 2015. hard to get more pro-life than that! for christmas this year  i’m going to get those pro-lifers cushions embroidered with the slogan “anti-vaxxers are anti-life”. sort out the climate crisis you know what’s pro-life? living happily in a world with a functioning ecosystem and enough clean water for all. you know what’s anti-life? everyone being wiped out by a terrible ball of fire. so i’m sure jabo waggoner  garlan gudger and the rest will join me in campaigning for a greener world and all the rest of the above. because if not  their “pro-life” stance would look less like it’s actually about life  and more about controlling and punishing women. and that couldn’t possibly be it  could it?", "how about the ‘pro-life’ lobby get behind these life-positive causes instead?

jones";"stephen burgen", "spain is heading to the polls for a “super sunday” of european  regional and municipal elections this weekend that will see madrid and barcelona’s city councils up for grabs and the socialist psoe party hoping to repeat its victory in last month’s general election. twelve of spain’s 17 autonomous regions will be voting to choose new governments  including the madrid region  which has been in the hands of the conservative people’s party (pp) since 1995  despite a series of corruption scandals. the pp suffered a drubbing in april’s general election after its strategy of moving to the right in a bid to see off the far-right vox party backfired spectacularly. the pp  led by pablo casado  is now trying to stake a claim to the centre ground in the hope of retaining its status as the main party of opposition amid competition from the centre-right citizens party. but the u-turn may not be enough to guarantee its hold on the madrid region. recent polls suggest that a leftwing coalition of the psoe  the anti-austerity unidas podemos and the more madrid platform  could secure a majority in the 132-seat regional parliament. such a result would prove another disaster for both casado and the pp. madrid’s progressive mayor  the former judge manuela carmena  has joined forces with iñigo errejón  once no 2 in podemos  and the two are running on a joint ticket: carmena for the mayoralty and errejón for the leadership of the madrid regional government. carmena has warned that vox  which won its first seats in the national parliament last month  will drag spain back to the past. “being against progress is being against life ” she said this week. “it is the engine of humanity. we want to carry on being the locomotive of progress in spain  europe and the world.” vox  meanwhile  is hoping a hardline approach will attract voters from the more traditional wing of the pp. although it picked up 24 seats in the general election  it failed to live up to expectations  perhaps because it relied too heavily on social media campaigns as it sought to circumvent the traditional media. the party has promised to build an “unbreachable wall” to keep migrants out of spain’s north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla  while its madrid candidates have denounced abortion and a woman’s right to choose. one of vox’s candidates for the european elections has continued the party’s attack on feminism  comparing “all those ugly feminists who tell spanish women what they have to do” to cinderella’s stepmother and stepsisters. the contest for the barcelona mayoralty is a two-horse race between the incumbent  ada colau of barcelona en comú  and the catalan republican left (erc) candidate  ernest maragall. the latest polls show the two neck and neck  with the socialist party’s jaume collboni in third. colau  whom her opponents blame for many of the city’s ills  from high rents to rising street crime and the proliferation of stateless street vendors  has a loyal base of voters. last week she received a boost in the form of an open letter to the city’s electors urging them to vote for her. it was signed by  among others  noam chomsky  naomi klein  new york mayor bill de blasio and the economist thomas piketty. maragall has two things in his favour: the increasingly solid vote for the erc  now the pre-eminent pro-independence party  and his name. his brother pasqual was a popular mayor from 1982 to 1997 and is credited with transforming the city into one of the world’s top tourist destinations. the wild card is the former french prime minister manuel valls  who has struggled to convince voters that he has the credentials to be mayor. although his father is catalan and he was born in the city and speaks the language  he has never lived in barcelona and to many he is a carpetbagger whose political career in france has run into the sand. colau is campaigning on her record of increased public spending  reducing air pollution  closing 4500 illegal tourist apartments  establishing a municipal electricity company and measures to build more nursery schools and increase the public housing stock. for catalan secessionists barcelona is both the weak link and the big prize. with about two-thirds of the population made up of either recent immigrants or people of non-catalan spanish ancestry  support for independence is lukewarm. colau is not a secessionist but does favour a referendum on independence. “i will never accept that the politics of barcelona should be subordinate to the national or independence question ” she told el país. “catalonia is not a republic and so barcelona can’t be the capital of a non-existent republic.” on friday  the governing body of the spanish parliament suspended four catalan mps who won seats in the general election but who remain on trial for their alleged roles in the regional government’s attempts to secede from spain in 2017. the four will now have to decided whether they resign their seats to hand them to colleagues  or leave them empty.", "spanish socialists aim to consolidate general election win", "2019-05-25t06:00:39z",

lesbian human rights commission said after the decision was announced. “they devastate people’s lives and have no place in a democratic kenyan society.” paul muite  a lawyer for the commission – the main petitioner in the case – said it would appeal. stonewall uk called the decision “crushing news”  while téa braun  the director of the human dignity trust  a campaign group using litigation to fight anti-lgbt prejudice  said it was a huge setback for human rights in kenya. “all kenyan citizens are guaranteed human dignity  equality before the law and freedom from discrimination under the 2010 constitution ” braun said. “yet in handing down this disappointing judgment  the court has ruled that a certain sector of society is undeserving of those rights.” homosexuality is illegal in most countries on the african continent. in several countries  gay people face life imprisonment or the death penalty. “the ruling sends a dangerous signal to the other 72 countries where citizens are made ‘criminals’ simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity ” braun added. hate crimes against gay people – including physical and sexual assault  blackmail and extortion – are common in kenya  but most victims are too fearful to go to the police  rights groups say. campaigners say the laws are also used daily to discriminate against lgbt people  making it harder for them to get a job or promotion  rent housing or access health and education services. kenya arrested 534 people for having same-sex relations between 2013 and 2017. according to petitioners against the law  there have been more than 1500 attacks against lgbt kenyans since 2014. the court heard from expert witnesses who said there have long been established traditions of tolerance of same-sex relationships in africa. it had been due to deliver its ruling in february  but postponed it until may. reform of the law was opposed by the kenya christian professionals forum  a coalition of catholic  protestant and evangelical churches. gerald walterfang  from the forum  said it was delighted with the ruling against a “destructive sexual lifestyle” and called the case “an attempt to sanitise what is illicit”. a 2013 survey found that 90% of the population in kenya did not think society should accept same-sex relationships. in several other african countries  levels of disapproval were even higher. last year president uhuru kenyatta told cnn that gay rights were “not of any major importance” in the country and that laws criminalising same-sex relations were supported by “99%” of the kenyan people. in neighbouring tanzania  authorities in dar es salaam  the biggest city  have launched a series of crackdowns on gay people in recent years. in the most recent the city’s governor called on citizens to identify gay people so they could be arrested  forcing hundreds of people into hiding. however there has been progress elsewhere  including angola  which decriminalised gay sex in january. in march  the high court in botswana heard a case brought by campaigners challenging the constitutionality of a law punishing same-sex relations. “the judgment is very sad but i am genuinely happy the kenyan lgbti movement came this far ” said bahiru shewaye  founder of the ethiopian lgbt advocacy and campaigning organisation house of guramayle  on friday . “as i have said to my kenyan rainbow family  they are visible and their existence is acknowledged. the fight is not over.”", "kenya court upholds ban on gay sex in major setback for activists", "2019-05-24t15:48:00z", "kenya";"lgbt rights";"africa";"world news"

one difference at the start of the french series is that mouche’s object of sexual fantasy is not barack obama but benoît hamon  the former french socialist party presidential candidate running in the european elections. under the contract  herry was allowed to add two or three scenes per episode. “i didn’t want to be adding things in ” she said. “it was about making sure it sounded right in france  so that it really seemed anchored in france. “we found it worked with paris decor and costumes. it’s a series that is not so much about england or english culture but about the times we’re living in. those times we’ve living in have a similar impact across europe and the western world and similar themes – personal connection  the difficulties of talking – at the heart of families. it’s all so universal that the connection worked.” the star of the french version is camille cottin  who already has a large following in the uk for her scathing role in the french comedy series call my agent  made by the state tv channel france 2 and now on netflix. cottin became famous in france for her excruciatingly funny sketches portraying a gleefully unaware character  connasse. she has been deemed a perfect on-screen match for waller-bridge. cottin  who lived in london as a teenager  said she discovered the series when her sister  an editor  was working on a documentary about women’s sexuality in british tv shows and recommended it. “she said: ‘you have to see this  the sisters are us.’ i watched it and it made me hysterical with joy and happiness.” cottin said the “brilliant english series” was incredible in its portrait of a character “who  faced with grief  unhappiness and despair  puts on this sunny  dazzling front when inside she’s destroyed”. the french name for the series came from cottin herself. she said the production team had been sitting around desperately trying to pick a french equivalent for the word fleabag but all the french versions seemed too modern or harsh. she said the word fleabag had an element of mystery  “so it was important to keep that mystery  that enigmatic  poetic  timeless side and not put something too modern in there”. she suggested mouche  her own nickname as a child. “i suggested it and they liked it ” she said. cottin  who described waller-bridge as “one of the greatest contemporary writers”  said she would have been terrified to meet her. she had emailed waller-bridge during shooting  saying she was scared but delighted to be taking on the role. she said she hadn’t expected a reply  knowing how busy waller-bridge was. but shortly afterwards she received a long  “very warm” reply wishing them luck. the remaking of tv series for international markets began with reality formats  like wife swap and supernanny  before taking off with scripted shows. the great bake off is now licensed to 32 countries. walter iuzzolino  an italian former tv producer who fronts channel 4’s world drama platform walter presents  said british television had been “an extraordinary source of intellectual property” for many years. “shows like the office and fleabag have become such hits because they are driven by extraordinary creative talent – their boldness and uniqueness is what made them so popular in the first place ” he said. “it’s no surprise that broadcasters around the world are keen to replicate such a successful formula. the challenge for any adaptation is to find a compelling piece of talent that can make the concept their own and can lend unique local flavour to the piece.” the series life on mars has been licensed to companies in russia  spain  the czech republic  south korea and  most recently  china. the british-irish psychological crime drama the fall was relocated from belfast to lyon as insoupçonnable  and last month it was announced that an indian version of luther was in the works. but with the success of each show very much dependent on how well it has been adapted for its new audience  not every one takes off. the 2008 german version of the it crowd – titled das iteam: die jungs an der maus (the iteam: the boys at the mouse) – was cancelled after only two episodes due to low ratings. • mouche

associates  saying: “we can help.” two months later  on 11 march 2014  pavlov contacted the firm in person  explaining: “i am interested in your service in obtaining st kitts and nevis economic citizenship and would like to proceed.” pavlov needed the passport  he said  because he was involved in litigation in the eastern caribbean supreme court and wanted to avoid visa difficulties when travelling to the region. he hoped to have the necessary documentation ready within three weeks. “if rules of the program allows i would like to apply for myself and three dependents including my wife ” pavlov added. brantley said his firm received an inquiry which did not lead to any work for the firm. he said there was “no evidence” pavlov had obtained citizenship. “i have never applied for or granted any citizenship other than russian ” pavlov said in an emailed statement to the guardian. “i don’t have any plans to acquire st kitts and nevis citizenship. i am not intended to comment whether i had these plans a years ago. after december 2017 i never instructed any professional in order to obtain any foreign citizenship for myself.” the meps ana gomes  a prominent campaigner against golden passports  and her colleague marietje schaake  have raised the matter in a letter to commission president jean-claude juncker  calling for immediate curbs on visa waivers for st kitts citizens. “we urge you to consider terminating the visa-free status program with st kitts and nevis ” the meps told juncker  “unless their authorities can provide full confidence that individuals  such as mr pavlov  are not slipping through the cracks  allowing them access to the european union.” pavlov had been placed on the parliament’s proposed blacklist  the letter states  “due to his central role in the klyuev organised crime group”  which was responsible for the moscow tax fraud. the letter highlights a number of cases in st kitts had sold passports to “questionable” people. these include the iranian banker ali sadr hasheminejad  who is awaiting trial on money laundering and sanctions-busting charges in the us  and whose maltese bank was shut following a money-laundering investigation  other iranian nationals under us sanctions  and jho low  the principle figure in malaysia’s massive 1mdb scandal. in an interview  gomes said the case highlighted problems with controls on entry into europe. “we must get rid of golden visas and golden passports. it’s a real danger for infiltration of the eu by all sorts of criminals  namely those involved in money laundering and in organised crime. we see these sort of all sorts of criminals are infiltrating the eu and this threatens the integrity of the schengen system.” starting with st kitts  mauritius and the seychelles in 2009  the eu has signed 27 visa waiver agreements. many of these are with states that now sell golden passports  whose main attraction is easy access to europe. their citizens may enter the schengen zone for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. in a statement  a spokesperson for commissioner dimitris avramopoulos  who leads on visa issues  said: “we are aware that there are countries whose citizens benefit from visa-free travel to the eu that run citizenship investor schemes. visa-free access to the european union should not be used to leverage individual investment in return for citizenship.” responding to the criticism  brantley said visa and passport sales were now a “global industry”. “many people live in volatile areas of the world who are legitimate business people and want protection. we do not wish to have our citizenship being abused … “in february of 2015 there was an election here [in nevis]  a new government came into office  and that new government has entirely reformed the sector to the point where we have the most stringent due diligence requirements in the world.” • after publication the office of premier mark brantley responded  saying: “the premier does not know and has never met mr pavlov and has therefore had no association or contact with him. mr pavlov does not hold and has never held a passport from st kitts and nevis. “his purported entries into the eu therefore have absolutely no connection with st kitts and nevis. the record must reflect that st kitts and nevis elected a new government in february 2015. that new government undertook a comprehensive review and overhaul of the country’s citizenship programme in 2015. “st kitts and nevis now has the most stringent due diligence requirements in the world. all incidents cited by the article are pre-2015. as a small developing country  st kitts and nevis values greatly its excellent relationship with the european union and will continue at all times to be a stable  reliable and trustworthy partner.”", "calls for europe to review border controls after blacklisted russian visits 70 times", "2019-05-24t07:00:06z", "europe";"caribbean";"world news";"russia";"uk security and counter-terrorism";"european union"

jail in the us after american prosecutors added 17 additional charges under the espionage act. he was previously charged with working to hack a pentagon computer system but now faces a maximum sentence of 175 years if convicted of all the charges. wikileaks editor-in-chief  kristinn hrafnsson  labelled the new charges “the evil of lawlessness in its purest form”  adding: “with the indictment  the ‘leader of the free world’ dismisses the first amendment – hailed as a model of press freedom around the world – and launches a blatant extraterritorial assault outside its border  attacking basic principles of democracy in europe and the rest of the world.” the new charges against assange raise profound questions about the freedom of the press under the first amendment of the

impact. * * * unfair blame – the national audit office has criticised the home office for failing to protect foreign students wrongly accused of cheating in an english language test they were required to sit as part of a visa application process. about 2500 students were forcibly removed from the uk and a further 7200 left the country after being warned they faced detention and removal if they stayed. many protested their innocence and of 12500 appeals in uk courts so far  3600 people have been vindicated. sir amyas morse  the head of the nao  said: “when the home office acted vigorously to exclude individuals and shut down colleges involved in the english language test cheating scandal  we think they should have taken an equally vigorous approach to protecting those who did not cheat but who were still caught up in the process  however small a proportion they might be. this did not happen.” * * * everest’s fatal queues – hundreds of climbers hoping to make it to the summit of the world’s tallest mountain have been forced to wait for hours in freezing temperatures at high altitude  as congestion built up at the peak. the delays have been linked to the deaths of at least three

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/24/brazil-president-jair-bolsonaro-calls-for-street-rallies-as-criticism-of-his-rule-intensifies", "tom phillips", "hardcore supporters of brazil’s president  jair bolsonaro  have urged his followers to flood the streets in defence of their leader on sunday amid mounting conservative angst over the far-right populist’s anarchic opening act in office. bolsonaro swept to power last october  his insurgent campaign turbocharged by widespread revolt at the corruption and economic misrule of the brazilian left. but seven months later  with brazil’s economy stuck in the doldrums  political infighting raging  and bolsonaro facing protests at home  rejection overseas and questions over corruption in both his party and his family  his approval ratings have plummeted to historic lows and several prominent supporters are publicly voicing regret. “i had to choose someone  and that someone was bolsonaro. but he has shown he doesn’t have the slightest intellectual or emotional capacity to administer brazil ” the rightwing singer lobão complained last week in an interview with valor econômico  brazil’s answer to the financial times. “it’s obvious the government is going to collapse ” he added. reinaldo azevedo  a rightwing commentator  offered an equally dismal evaluation. “if … bolsonaro continues to listen only to the horde of lunatics that surrounds him  he won’t finish his term ” he warned in an article about brazil’s “shallow and petty” leader. in an editorial headlined the bolsonaro threat  the conservative newspaper o estado de são paulo – which has emerged as a particularly ferocious critic of brazil’s president – said he had “shown a shocking unpreparedness for the job”. that might be remedied by competent ministers  it argued. but bolsonaro had packed his administration with “toadies whose only function seems to be confirming the president’s daydreams”. bolsonaro has reacted to the intensifying barrage of friendly fire by escalating his populist rhetoric and calling diehard supporters to the streets. “the big problem is our political class ” bolsonaro  a career politician who falsely paints himself as a political outsider  claimed this week. “we have a unique opportunity to change brazil. but i won’t be able to do it alone.” fernando sampaio  an activist for bolsonaro’s social liberal party (psl) in the south-eastern state of minas gerais  said he would heed that call on sunday. “i feel it is my duty and obligation to take part ” he said. “the bolsonaro government has come to cause a rupture in the current system – and that is what he has been doing … but he cannot do this alone … [he] needs to mobilise the people.” but critics – including many on the right – have condemned sunday’s demonstrations as a dangerous attempt to radicalise brazil’s politics and intimidate its institutions. several fliers promoting the marches depict them as part of a bolsonarian bid to close brazil’s congress and supreme court. one online advert features the image of a knights templar warrior carrying brazil’s green and yellow flag and the slogan “let’s save brazil”. another urges bolsonaro supporters to “invade” the capital  brasília  to give brazil’s political elite a taste of “the rage of the people”. janaína paschoal  a psl congresswoman who was instrumental in bolsonaro’s rise and nearly became his presidential running-mate  urged fellow conservatives to shun his attempt to sow “chaos”. “i didn’t stay silent over the crimes of the left and i will not remain silent about the irresponsibility of the right ” she tweeted. kim kataguiri  another prominent rightwinger  said his group  the free brazil movement (mbl)  would not attend the protest or engage in “blind idolatry”. monica de bolle  director of latin american studies at johns hopkins university  said such opposition highlighted growing dissatisfaction among bolsonaro voters at his administration. “they just see dysfunction … if we think trump is unprepared for office  bolsonaro is 100 times that … this is the reality that’s sinking in.” steven levitsky  a harvard university professor of government  said he was not surprised that  having failed to build coalitions within brazil’s highly fragmented congress to pass key reforms  bolsonaro would try to attack it with “demagogic appeals to the masses” such as sunday’s protests. “autocrats – and i think it is pretty safe to call bolsonaro a pretty autocratic leader – like to govern unilaterally  and brazil is difficult to govern unilaterally ” he said. but with bolsonaro’s approval ratings this week sinking to under 29%  levitsky said he doubted such tactics would work. “this seems a very risky endeavour for bolsonaro  more likely to end in his isolation ” he said. “bolsonaro has made a number of errors and his public support has flagged as a result – and that is probably a good thing for democracy. it’s always better to have an inept and unpopular autocrat in power  than a talented and popular one. i prefer trump to orbán any day.”", "diehard bolsonaro supporters prepare to march as criticism of

they instead look at the credibility of the complainant. practically  that means that the [police] will almost disregard what has happened and look at who it happened to. “i’ve had clients who told me that [they had] told police they’d been drinking  or they’d been flirting with [the accused]. immediately in those situations  the police don’t focus on the credibility of her complaint  but they seem to view her through a negative prism of ‘she’s a slut’  ‘she’s a drunk’ or ‘she led him on’. “[police] continue to struggle under the illusion that there is a real rape: that it happens in public  it happens by a stranger and there’s a physical injury. the research doesn’t support that.” in november  a woman walked into a gold coast police station to report a sexual assault. in front of her rape crisis counsellor  the police officer told her there were “no real rapes” on the glitter strip. “what we have most of the time is buyer’s regret ” the officer said. the ‘mistake of fact’ defence in march  the retired queensland supreme court justice roslyn atkinson said the “mistake of fact” defence was outdated and could allow men to invoke rape “myths” to escape conviction. the lawyer and writer bri lee and the bond university law professor jonathan crowe have co-authored a study and created a website to demonstrate how the defence has been used  particularly against vulnerable complainants  including children and people with disabilities. lee has organised the letter-writing campaign. “there’s nothing particularly bold about [calls for reform]  particularly when you consider queensland in this particular area of law is years behind the rest of australia ” lee said. “people just cannot seem to believe this is what the law actually is in queensland.” opponents to change have argued that removing the defence would be a “romance killer”. sarkozi has represented victims who had been badly injured but did not secure a conviction “because of the power of cross-examination  and because the jury has its own biases about what a real rape survivor should look like”. “society also has the version of rape occurring to virgins who don’t drink and get raped by strangers ” she said. sarkozi said the legal situation created a “trickle-down” effect that influenced the way police responded to rape complaints. she said that while the law needed to be reformed  queensland police also needed to engage in a whole-of-systems audit and review related to rape and sexual assault. “the police are aware of how information is going to come across in a court ” sarkozi said. “they’re aware how she might be cross-examined. while i understand how they might be trying to help the victim with their expectations about what might happen in court  it really backfires. victims end up walking away from reporting to the police thinking ‘the police don’t believe me  the police think there is no point’. “[police] seem to focused on the end game and that does mean they can behave in a really appalling way. they seem to be blind to the living  breathing  distressed victim  and only concerned about the conviction rate.” the police service said in a statement the qps was “committed to providing a timely and professional response to supporting victims of sexual assault”. “there are various levels of mandatory and discretionary investigative and awareness training undertaken by police regarding responses to sexual assaults and dealing with vulnerable persons ” the statement said. “this includes a range of investigative courses  recruit training and online learning products specialising in dealing with victims and a greater focus on domestic and family violence.” the state attorney-general  yvette d’ath  said the government was considering the views of legal stakeholders and reviewing court of appeal judgments handed down in the past 20 years. “sexual assaults are particularly heinous crimes and people who commit these offences must be held to account ” d’ath said.", "campaign for change puts queensland's rape laws under the spotlight", "2019-05-24t00:00:16z", "sexual harassment";"australia news";"rape and sexual assault";"crime - australia";"women"

prime minister  narendra modi  has claimed a landslide victory in national elections that cements the hindu nationalist leader as the country’s most formidable politician in decades. modi’s ruling bharatiya janata party (bjp) had been expected to easily form a governing coalition with smaller allies  but official results showed the party ahead in at least 300 seats  comfortably beyond the 272 seats required for a majority in the lower house of parliament. its main national opponent  congress  was leading in just 50 constituencies and its party president  rahul gandhi  was turfed out of his family’s bastion seat of amethi in uttar pradesh state. “together we grow ” modi said on twitter as the results came in. “together we prosper. together we will build a strong and inclusive india. india wins yet again!” in a later televised address  he was critical of those who had doubted the bjp could increase its majority. “the political pundits of india have to leave behind their ideas of the past ” he said. this year’s polls  held over seven phases starting on 11 april  have been described as a contest for the soul of india. they pitted modi’s hindu nationalist government against a disparate group of opposition parties including congress  whose secular vision has defined the country for most of the past 72 years. votes from 542 lower-house constituencies – one fewer than usual after authorities discovered £1.3m in unaccounted cash in a south indian party leader’s home and cancelled the poll there – started being counted at 8am local time (3.30am gmt)  and results were released progressively throughout the day. by early thursday evening the bjp had won in close to 20 constituencies in the crucial state of west bengal – up from just two seats in 2014 – while holding off a co-ordinated challenge from opposition parties in the hindi heartland states of north india  where its support had been expected to fall from the high watermark of five years ago. now it appears 2014 was no aberration  and that indian politics has likely entered a new era of hindu nationalist hegemony fuelled by modi’s extraordinary popularity. “we are in an era where you have  once more  a central gravitational force around which indian politics revolves ” said milan vaishnav  the director of the south asia programme at the carnegie endowment for international peace. “i think 2019 will confirm that the bjp has replaced the congress as that.” nationalist agenda the emphatic victory will be greeted with dismay among some members of religious minority groups  who have voiced fears that a returned bjp government would be further emboldened to prosecute its hindu nationalist agenda  including controversial citizenship-status checks to root out unauthorised migrants in border states. the bjp’s president  amit shah  described illegal migrants in the country’s north-east as “termites” in one speech that was widely condemned by opponents. among the bjp candidates who won on thursday was pragya singh thakur  a hindu nun and terrorism accused who is still facing trial for involvement in a 2008 bombing plot that killed six muslims and injured scores of others. alongside nationalism and modi’s personal magnetism  the bjp’s victory was also fuelled by a relentless  data-driven and highly disciplined style of campaigning. the party sent up to 20 campaigners to manage the area around each polling booth  ensuring they knew their possible voters and what messages would resonate with them  an evolution from the older style of courting or inducing local chieftains to bring out their villages to vote. “we had organisations sitting in every booth and that’s unprecedented ” said rajat sethi  a bjp strategist. modi the master the decisions of voters in the vast country of 1.3 billion people have been driven by innumerable local concerns  caste and religion  or rumours and opinions traded over whatsapp or cups of chai at a tea stand. but the figure of modi has towered over the contest like no prime minister since indira gandhi in the 1970s. “there is no match for modi among the opposition parties ” said rahul verma  a fellow at the delhi-based centre for policy research. “he’s running at nearly an all-time high popularity. he’s charismatic  and people still repose faith in him despite not being very happy with the economic side of the government’s performance.” a survey released this week by the centre for the study of developing societies found that nearly one-third of people who voted for the bjp did so in support of modi  rather than the party or their local candidate. modi’s popularity had actually grown compared with 2014  when he led his party to the first majority victory in 30 years  the researchers said. the months leading to the election were bumpy for the bjp. a government survey revealed unemployment to be the highest in 45 years. data showing that farming incomes had plummeted to their lowest point in 18 years confirmed the distress of agricultural workers  some of who had marched on delhi carrying skulls that they said belonged to farmers who had committed suicide due to drought and mounting debt. modi’s promise on the 2014 campaign trail that “good days are coming” threatened to turn into a millstone around his neck. then a bombing in the disputed territory of kashmir on 14 february helped to transform the contest. rather than dent modi’s strongman image  the killing of 40 indian paramilitaries by a pakistan-based militant group became the stage for his response  an airstrike deeper in neighbouring territory than indian jets had ever struck. “it really put a premium on leadership ” said vaishnav. “it spoke to the attributes that modi often touts about himself: decisiveness  muscularity  nationalism and to a certain extent people started to see the vote not about a choice between political alternatives but a vote for the nation.” modi styled himself as “chowkidar” – hindi for watchman – and made national security the dominant message of the early part of his campaign. congress licks wounds congress never found its footing again after the pakistan strikes and has been outgunned by the bjp’s deep pockets and disciplined party machine. conceding defeat on thursday evening  gandhi declined to speculate on what had gone wrong. “what matters is that the people of india have decided that narendra modi will be prime minister  and as an indian person i respect it ” he said. gandhi will continue to serve in parliament from a second seat in kerala state that he won handily on thursday. a report by the association for democratic reforms (adr) found that the bjp took in more than 73% of the donations declared by india’s seven largest political parties in 2017-18. the ruling party spent more than 260m rupees (£2.9m) on advertisements on facebook  youtube  google and instagram  compared with 35m rupees by congress. many opposition leaders tried to paper over their differences to form a broad anti-modi coalition. they said it would be enough to oust the leader  who won office with just over 30% of the national vote share five years ago. but their alliance was purely instrumental and had failed to inspire voters  verma said. the process of counting more than 600m votes used to take up to 40 hours but the growing use of electronic voting machines since 1982 has made things considerably quicker.", "india election results 2019: modi claims landslide victory", "2019-05-23t12:45:16z", "india elections 2019";"narendra modi";"india";"rahul gandhi";"south

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/narendra-modi-from-impoverished-tea-seller-to-master-of-political-theatre", "michael safi", "the boy who once sold tea at a railway station has become the most influential indian leader in generations  winning a landslide in election results announced on thursday. or so goes the story that has become the core of narendra modi’s extraordinary appeal. modi  68  was born to a poor family in western india’s gujarat state  where he developed a strong dislike for the ruling congress party as a result of hanging around a political office near his father’s tea stall. while still a child  he started attending daily meetings of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  said to be the world’s largest volunteer organisation  whose hindu nationalist ideology envisions the country’s diverse hindu population as a single nation with a sacred culture that should be given primacy in india. hindu nationalists were sidelined by india’s founding prime minister  jawaharlal nehru  whose vision of india was of a secular nation at ease with its bewildering plurality. their parties  including modi’s bharatiya janata party (bjp)  struggled to win more than 10% of the national vote for decades until the 1990s  when they started to expand on the back of a national campaign to demolish a 16th-century mughal mosque and replace it with a hindu temple. that push culminated in the destruction of the mosque by a mob of 150000 hindu activists  which triggered rioting across india that killed an estimated 2000 people. still  the bjp’s support was limited to wealthier hindus in the country’s north and west  with resistance to the party from poor  marginalised hindus  muslims and south indians thought to be permanent hurdles to hindu nationalist domination. modi’s magnetism  especially his personal branding as a tea boy who climbed to the country’s highest ranks  has changed those calculations  drawing vast support from the country’s emerging middle and lower-middle classes. “he has managed to create this voting bloc – other party’s voters who are voting for the bjp just for modi ” said rahul verma  a fellow at the delhi-based centre for policy research. “the shifts are actually happening among the more aspirational voters  who think modi can fulfil their economic aspirations … this leader  who has risen from the ranks of a poor family  has become a symbol.” this symbolism was especially potent among young indians  a vital and growing electorate in a country with a median age younger than 28. “they have grown up seeing the way of life in the west and in places like singapore and china ” said vivan marwaha  a journalist who is writing a book on young indians. “and modi came on to the scene in 2014 and promised them bullet trains  a million new jobs  the world’s largest statue. it’s all very aspirational.” young indians had grown up being told their country was on the cusp of becoming a superpower. in modi  he said  they had a leader who spoke as if it already was. alongside aspiration  the bjp promotes a vision of hindu cultural supremacy that sidelines the country’s 300m minority population. as chief minister of gujarat state  modi was a firebrand hindutva campaigner. in 2002  anti-muslim riots in his state killed at least 1000 people  resulted in the future prime minister becoming an international pariah who was banned from entering the us. in response  modi presented himself as an outsider being attacked by elites: a refrain that would become a central part of his political messaging. “he would say he was constantly being targeted by the english-speaking media out of delhi ” said nilanjan mukhopadhyay  author of a biography of the indian leader. “he made himself the symbol of the underdog  projected himself as somebody who is against the status quo forces.” the times came to suit modi. when popular disgust at corruption scandals plaguing the previous congress government boiled over into street protests in 2011  it provided the rightwing populist leader a national springboard. “modi was at the forefront of projecting this strong  centralising leadership ” said milan vaishnav  the director of the south asia program at the carnegie endowment for international peace. “he realised what people are looking for is somebody who gets stuff done.” his mastery of political theatre  and finger on the pulse of indians  has now secured him the strongest mandate of any leader in decades. but it will do little to create jobs  alleviate financial stress in the country’s vast agriculture sector or grow the economy on the backdrop of a us trade war and a global slowdown. “issues of economy will be the focus of his first 100 days ” said rajat sethi  a fellow at the influential bjp-aligned india foundation thinktank. he said modi could also look to broaden a programme of targeted payments to farmers and other struggling groups. the scale of thursday’s victory creates room for modi to ram through reforms  but also the possibility that he may not have to  said gilles verniers  a political scientist who teaches at haryana state’s ashoka university. “it is a peculiar result because there were a multitude of ground realities that were clearly going against the bjp. it won despite jobless growth  rural distress  a tepid economy ” said verniers. “it’s as if all those adverse factors did not matter at all. “and so the worry is that it could translate into a belief the the bjp can win despite poor performance  and that may not not necessarily translate into incentives to address the deeper issues with the economy.”", "narendra modi: from impoverished tea seller to master of political theatre", "2019-05-23t12:10:00z", "narendra modi";"world

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/in-germanys-smallest-state-traditional-politics-is-in-tatters-bremen-germany", "philip oltermann", "a bronze statue outside bremen town hall reminds visitors this northern german port city inspired one of the world’s most enduring fairytales. the grimm brothers’ town musicians of bremen tells the story of a donkey  a dog  a cat and a rooster who escape their masters and join forces to seek their fortunes in the city. when bremen  the smallest of germany’s 16 federal states  votes in regional elections on sunday  held at the same time as the european parliamentary election  the result is likely to demonstrate a trend across the rest of the country. for german politics  the future could lie in once unimaginable collaborations as traditional parties fade. ruled for 74 years by the social democratic party (spd)  polls for the city’s elections are predicting devastating losses that could force the struggling centre-left party to team up with the greens and the leftwing die linke  a group that grew out of the ruling party of socialist east germany. such a move would be a first for a state in germany’s old west  30 years after the fall of the berlin wall. relishing its status as kingmaker  the buoyant green party could opt instead to enter a power-sharing deal with the bremen branch of the christian democratic union (cdu)  once led by angela merkel  a move which some speculate could prove such a shock to the spd that it will walk out of government in berlin  where it is a junior partner. if that led to snap elections  with the cdu campaigning under merkel’s successor  annegret kramp-karrenbauer  a “black-green” coalition could also happen at a national level. one poll earlier this month put the cdu at 30% and the green party at 20% of the vote. bremen  with a population of 550000  is not one of germany’s 10 largest cities  yet over the decades it has regularly proven to be a reliable testing ground for political experiments. in 1991 bremen was the setting for the first power-sharing arrangement between the social democrats  the greens and the pro-business free democrats. in 2007 it was the first stateto seat die linke members in its parliament. “bremen is a special kind of state ” said kristina vogt  who is leading die linke into her third election. more so than the two other city-states  berlin and hamburg  it is “a city of short distances”  she said  “both in terms of transport and in a political sense”. “my feeling is that the traditional party system as we know it is in the process of being dissolved. the big centrist parties are shrinking  and i don’t think they will return to their old strength. small parties are growing  and in the end you will have all sorts of coalitions between parties that can find pragmatic solutions together.” an “r2g” (two red  one green) coalition between the centre-left spd  die linke and the greens would currently struggle to form a governing majority. the split on the german left goes back to the days of rosa luxemborg and remains deep  especially on foreign policy. yet many figures in all three parties believe an r2g coalition to be germany’s only realistic hope of a left-leaning  progressive government  and think such an alliance should be a strategic goal for the next elections. bremen’s spd mayor  carsten sieling  has stated his preference for r2g in the city  and railed against “that terrible grand coalition” with merkel’s cdu in berlin. a more significant reason why sieling’s party is set for its worst result since the end of the second world war is not the government in berlin  but the fact that during more than 70 years of spd rule bremen has plummeted from being one of germany’s richest states to its poorest  with the country’s highest unemployment rate  at 9.7%. home to lush green areas and architectural marvels  bremen is also a city of struggling schools and crumbling buildings. on stephani bridge  in the city centre  lorries must drive at 50 metre intervals and half the cycle path is closed for fear of overloading the ageing structure. the cdu challenger  carsten meyer-heder  who is leading in the polls  says he wants to dismantle the mentality that has allowed the city’s heritage to wither. the party’s poster campaign features the 58-year-old’s bald head poking into the frame under the caption “wrecking ball”. a former it entrepreneur who has been a member of merkel’s party for only a year  meyer-heder’s central pitch is that bremen can only regain its former glory by concentrating its resources on a small number of innovative projects  such as model schools specialising in digital learning. however  a closer look at his manifesto reveals unexpectedly statist solutions: like die linke  bremen’s cdu wants the city to keep a majority in the housing cooperative gewoba. “we need it to build social housing ” said meyer-heder. “we can’t leave that to the free market  it won’t work.” for now  the cdu has ruled out a coalition with die linke  but its lead candidate admits: “i sometimes find myself sharing a podium with her [vogt] and she comes out with the same lines i was going to say.” while vogt says: “i could imagine that within 10 years we could have really strange  de-ideologised coalitions.” will germany’s first conservative-socialist one day pass the donkey  dog  cat and duck as it enters the town hall? “i think it won’t be unthinkable in eight years ” she replies.", "in germany's smallest state  traditional politics is in tatters", "2019-05-23t12:01:10z",

prospect of falling on her prime ministerial sword or being booted out of downing street by her own party amid open cabinet revolt over her brexit plan and widely predicted calamity for the conservatives in today’s european elections. the resignation of andrea leadsom from the cabinet last night topped off a day that will stand as one of the most disastrous in her three-year stint in no 10. the leader of the house said in her resignation letter that she no longer believed the pm’s plan could deliver the referendum result and followed signals from other ministers that they would support the most contentious part of may’s proposal: a vote for mps on a second referendum. the european elections are likely to see the tories wiped out by nigel farage’s brexit party and many mps believe may’s own resignation will now come after she meets 1922 committee chairman graham brady tomorrow morning. “graham hinted that he expects her to resign. we all expect her to resign ” said one. today’s papers also have no doubt that it’s the end of the road. leadsom’s supporters  meanwhile  hope her departure will give her momentum to challenge fellow brexiters boris johnson and dominic raab for the party leadership if it becomes vacant. penny mordaunt  michael gove and sajid javid are also among the likely contenders. * * * ‘choose your future’ – rarely can nationwide elections have been so dreaded by both main parties. forecasters are predicting that the brexit party will win the biggest share of the vote in european elections today  possibly as much as 37%. the consequences for the tory party are potentially disastrous but labour could end up being pushed into third place behind the resurgent liberal democrats. dan sabbagh crunches the numbers. in an effort to boost dwindling turnout across the bloc  the european commission has produced a video featuring new-born babies to encourage people across the bloc to “choose their future”. in eastern europe  shaun walker reports on how the continent’s estimated 10 million roma are the forgotten constituents at a time when populist parties are stepping up attempts to demonise them. * * * take care – old people should be given free care to help them eat  wash and get dressed in order to improve their health and reduce the need for hospital stays  a thinktank has said. the plan would need to be funded by a 2p increase in income tax but much of the cost would be partly offset by £4.5bn worth of savings in the nhs. the report by the institute for public policy research argues that the nhs principle of free care at the point of need should be extended to this element of social care services in england. it has been free in scotland since 2002. * * * record ruling – a federal judge will not prevent banks from providing the financial records of donald trump  three of his children and the trump organization to democrats investigating the us president’s businesses. judge edgardo ramos ruled that congress has the authority to demand the records  clearing the way for deutsche bank and capital one to comply with subpoenas issued by two house of representatives committees last month. trump’s lawyers are expected to appeal the decision as he continues his increasingly acrimonious fight against congressional investigations. earlier in the day  trump ended a meeting with democratic leaders after just a few minutes  saying that he will not work with them on infrastructure projects unless they stop investigating him. * * * india awaits – early results point to landslide victory for narendra modi’s bjp after counting started this morning in the indian election. although it might be a while before the definitive tallies are known – more than 600 million ballots have been cast – the charismatic prime minister seems certain to claim a second term in office for his hindu nationalist party. a struggling economy at first threatened to undermine modi’s claims that “good days are coming”. but the killing of 40 indian paramilitaries by militants in kashmir enabled modi to make security  one of his strong suits  the dominant issue. * * * stroke improvement – deaths from strokes in england have halved in the past 10 years thanks to better treatment  according to a study. the incidence among older people has fallen because of medical interventions to control their blood pressure  such as

walker", "pata-rât is just a few miles outside cluj-napoca  in north-west romania  but it feels a world away from the pretty streets and baroque architecture of the bustling city centre. here  rubbish from the city and region is deposited in vast mounds  and the air is thick with the smell of rotting waste. about 1800 people call pata-rât home  almost all of them of roma origin  living in depressing and unsanitary conditions in a makeshift camp backing onto a landfill site. many were evicted from housing in the city centre and forced into the camp’s crowded huts. linda zsiga  a 37-year-old roma woman who spent several years living in pata-rât after she and her family were evicted with just two days notice from dwellings in central cluj back in 2010  has been campaigning to close the site  and rehouse its residents in social housing inside the city. so far  she has had little success  despite government promises and pressure from european bodies. “nobody deserves to live here ” she said  waving in the direction of the main dump. “when i lived here  i couldn’t even open the windows in my own house  because of the smell. everyone who needs social housing should be able to get it.” zsiga wanted to stand in this weekend’s european elections  as an mep candidate for a newly founded left-leaning coalition  but the group was not able to collect the 200000 signatures a new party requires to register in romania. across the european union  there are only a tiny number of roma candidates standing in the polls  and even fewer are likely to get elected. pata-rât is one of many stark reminders of the poor conditions in which millions of roma people live. while some progress has been made on access to education and healthcare in the past decade  in many parts of europe roma are confined to effective ghettos  and subject to widespread discrimination. there are believed to be as many as 10 million roma people in europe  as many as a medium-sized eu country  and the community’s lack of representation is particularly alarming at a time when populist forces are stepping up a campaign to demonise them in many countries. in france earlier this year  vigilante groups attacked roma people in paris after fake news reports alleged they were kidnapping children. in italy  one of the first acts of the far-right interior minister  matteo salvini  last year was to call for the creation of a register for roma people. in hungary  a newly founded extreme-right party called on its followers this week to fight “gypsy crime”. “it’s difficult for politicians to sustain islamophobic hysteria for too long. the panic about refugees and migrants has subsided a bit and the roma have become a scapegoat again ” said bernard rorke  of the european roma rights centre. in central and eastern european countries such as slovakia  hungary and romania  many roma live in ghetto-like conditions similar to those at pata-rât  confined to ramshackle settlements on the edge of towns and often excluded from education and the jobs market. “to make changes it is crucial to have people where decisions are taken ” said soraya post  an mep from sweden’s feminist initiative  who is of roma origin and helped set up an annual roma week in brussels. post is standing for re-election  but has few roma colleagues in the current parliament: one german green mep and one from fidesz  the party of hungarian prime minister  viktor orbán  with whom post says it is not feasible to work. the hungarian government promotes itself as a model for roma empowerment  but critics say the government has merely shunted many people into low-paid public works programmes  entrenching segregation. rorke characterised the hungarian attitude to the roma community as “keep them in poverty  keep them in public works schemes  and make sure they’re not doing crystal meth and not getting pregnant”. this reinforced segregation and discrimination rather than combatting it  he said. in romania  where there are around 1 million or more roma people  there is not a popular far-right party  but the self-perpetuating cycle of segregation and discrimination has long been part of society. there have been numerous national and european schemes and funding projects aimed at roma people  but without proper consultations they often fail to make significant change. “so far  quite a lot of money has been spent  but with little effect. we need to rely on public consultations and identify specific needs  rather than find them in the imagination of politicians ” said the romanian eu official ciprian necula  who helped organise a pre-election debate over the weekend with candidates from seven different romanian parties that focused exclusively on roma issues. at pata-rât  when families first moved into the area around the rubbish dump  children were taunted for being dirty and smelly  said zsiga  reinforcing the cycle of segregation and discrimination. after nearly a decade living at the camp  most of the makeshift houses now have running water and electricity  but the camp is still hardly fit for habitation  and is cut off from public transport routes or paved roads. two years ago  zsiga moved into an apartment in cluj  one of around 20 homes funded by a norwegian governmental grant  but many of her family members still live at the camp. not everyone is desperate to leave: some families in the camp scrape by on money they make from sorting recyclables from the landfill site  and fear that if moved  they would lose even this small source of income. zsiga  however  said that any opposition to its closure was due to a lack of self-esteem among the community. “many roma people think ‘because i am roma  i deserve to be poor; because i am roma i deserve to live on the garbage dump’ ” she said. “but look at this place. if we let roma people live like this  what chance do their kids have to have normal lives?” post  the swedish mep  agreed: “the consequences of centuries of exclusion make people feel they cannot challenge the society. your self image is also that you don’t actually belong to this society.”", "no voice  no future? roma ignored

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/idlib-bargaining-chip-civilians-brace-assad-air-assault-escalates", "bethan mckernan", "instead of looking forward to the pre-dawn ramadan meal of suhoor  dr firas al-jundi was cradling his scared children and surveying the damage done to his home by syrian government airstrikes. at least 11 people died in the overnight bombing on wednesday of maaret al-numan in idlib province  the syrian opposition’s last stronghold in the country  in the latest spasm of violence in an escalated campaign on the area by bashar al-assad’s forces. most of his home’s windows had been broken  but jundi’s family escaped shaken but safe. arriving at his hospital  he immediately began triaging more than 50 injured people. “we are dealing with huge numbers of head injuries  amputations  paralysis cases ” he told the guardian by phone. “routine procedures are on hold.” idlib and the surrounding countryside are supposedly covered by a de-escalation deal brokered by russia and turkey last autumn  which saved the area from an impending regime assault. it has unravelled since january  when control of the area was wrested from more moderate rebel groups by the hardline hayat tahrir al-sham (hts). unlike the scorched earth campaigns in aleppo  ghouta and other areas clawed back by assad with help from his russian allies  idlib has been subjected to a limited ground campaign accompanied by airstrikes  carried out under the pretext of destroying hts. while the russian president  vladimir putin  has said a full-scale assault on idlib is “impractical” for the time being  a ferocious new aerial attack began in earnest last month  raising fears that the final battle in syria’s eight-year war would be a gruelling attritional fight. neighbouring turkey  which backs idlib’s rebel groups  faces the dilemma of whether or not to absorb any fleeing refugees. turkey is already home to 3.6 million syrians and the government is unwilling to provide shelter for potentially millions more. aid agencies warned before the ceasefire was brokered last year that an assault on idlib would put the lives of 3 million civilians in danger and trigger the worst humanitarian disaster of the war to date. originally home to about 1 million people  idlib’s population has swollen with civilians displaced by fighting elsewhere in the country  and there is now nowhere else left for them to go unless turkey opens its border. the world health organization says 18 hospitals in idlib have been targeted and destroyed by regime bombing and at least 223 people have been killed since 20 april  monitors say. more than 200000 people have been displaced from their homes by the renewed violence and the majority of aid funding and support has dried up as several organisations halted their work in the area after the hts takeover. “we only have two ambulances and one van now ” said obaida othman  the head of the civil defence rescue service centre in the town of kafranbel  which was destroyed in airstrikes on 13 may. “despite the hot weather we are staying in the outskirts of our town among the trees in order to hide from the warplanes. we are doing our best to survive the purposeful attacks in order to save other lives.” rebel forces in the area are fighting back hard  launching a wave of counterattacks to reclaim lost territory on the southern edge of the deescalation zone and shelling syrian army and russian positions in neighbouring latakia. opposition shelling of government areas in recent weeks has killed at least 25 civilians  according to the uk-based monitor the syrian observatory for human rights. “scorched earth policy  that’s the only language russia and the regime understand ” said naji al-mustafa  a spokesperson for the rebel umbrella group the national front for liberation. “we are inflicting losses on the enemy [for their] barbaric crimes against civilians.” without airpower  however  the longterm odds are not in the opposition’s favour  and idlib’s fate mainly hinges on the brittle relationship between turkey and russia. moscow has lost patience with ankara  which failed to contain and disarm hts in its role as guarantor of last year’s ceasefire. idlib has strategic importance for both russia and turkey  but it is not either country’s priority in syria – both are more focussed on the balance of power in the kurdish-held north-east  where the us is supposedly withdrawing troops. “idlib is a bargaining chip at this point and it’s extremely difficult to anticipate what happens next ” said dareen khalifa  a senior syria analyst for the international crisis group. “turkey is maintaining its observation posts in idlib and has 1200 troops on the ground there. they don’t show any signs of budging yet. at the same time  russia can continue to push very hard in idlib because it strengthens their hand when negotiating with turkey on other issues. “sad as it sounds  given the humanitarian cost  all parties are going to continue to try and destabilise the others.” additional reporting by hussein akoush", "'idlib is a bargaining chip': civilians brace as assad air assault escalates",

borger", "the united nations general assembly has overwhelmingly backed a motion condemning britain’s occupation of the remote chagos islands in the indian ocean. the 116-6 vote left the uk diplomatically isolated and was also a measure of severely diminished us clout on the world stage. washington had campaigned vigorously at the un and directly in talks with national capitals around the world in defence of the uk’s continued control of the archipelago  where there is a us military base at diego garcia. the vote was in support of a motion setting a six-month deadline for britain to withdraw from the chagos island chain and for the islands to be reunified with neighbouring mauritius. it endorsed an advisory opinion issued by the international court of justice (icj) in february  calling on the uk to relinquish its hold on the territory in order to complete the process of decolonisation. the us  hungary  israel  australia and the maldives backed the uk in the vote and 56 countries abstained  including france  germany  the netherlands  portugal  poland and romania. other european allies including austria  greece  ireland  spain  sweden and switzerland voted for the uk to relinquish sovereignty. the scale of the defeat for the uk and us came as a surprise even to mauritius  in view of the concerted campaign pursued by london and washington. “even we didn’t expect support for the uk to go into single figures ” jagdish koonjul  the mauritian ambassador to the un  told the guardian. “more importantly  this has happened despite the huge  huge  pressure on national capitals and at the un.” british diplomats said the non-binding resolution would have little practical impact. but it has taken a political toll  draining support for the uk in the general assembly and focusing dissatisfaction over its permanent seat on the un security council. it lost its seat on the icj two years ago. mauritius now intends to challenge uk membership of the indian ocean tuna commission. the uk retained possession of the chagos archipelago after mauritius gained independence in 1968  effectively paying mauritius more than £4m for the islands. the islands  known by the foreign office as the british indian ocean territory (biot)  include diego garcia  used by us bombers on long-range missions and  in the past  for rendition flights carrying terrorism suspects. the uk and us lobbied intensely at the un to try to avoid support for britain dropping to single figures among the un’s 193 member states. the mauritian prime minister  pravind jugnauth  was present for the debate. karen pierce  the uk’s permanent representative at the un  said the large number of abstentions reflected many countries’ unease about the precedent set by the motion. in london  the foreign office stressed the importance of the partnership with the us over the diego garcia military base. “the joint uk-us defence facility on the british indian ocean territory helps to keep people in britain and around the world safe from terrorism  organised crime and piracy ” a spokeswoman said. “as the us government has made clear  the status of biot as a uk territory is essential to the value of the joint facility and our shared interests – an arrangement that cannot be replicated.” the spokeswoman added: “we remain disappointed that this matter was referred to the international court of justice and the un general assembly. the basic principle that the icj should not consider bilateral sovereignty disputes without the consent of both states concerned has been circumvented and this could have wide-reaching implications for all un member states.” during the debate the maldives representative said her country would not support the motion because of the “serious implications for the security of the indian ocean region”. the cypriot representative said his country supported the motion  pointing out that removal of “parcels of land” in the process of decolonisation usually involved an element of coercion. the foreign office is eager to maintain good relations with mauritius  a fellow commonwealth member  despite the dispute. the uk views biot’s defence and security role as vital. the islands are close to some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. diego garcia is a pivotal location for monitoring and tackling drugs trafficking  piracy and crime in the indian ocean and has been used as a base for supporting humanitarian responses  such as after the 2004 tsunami. the uk government publicly acknowledged in 2008 that diego garcia had twice been used for us rendition flights  both in 2002. it has received assurances that the base will not be used for rendition in the future. the uk recently set aside £40m for exiled chagossians who live mainly in the uk  seychelles and mauritius. relatively little has been spent so far because programmes are being developed. some money has been used to pay for five group heritage visits  in which 76 exiled chagossians have been allowed back to visit ancestral graves and spend up to a week on the archipelago. before the result  the uk government was resigned to many countries voting against it on the totemic issue of decolonisation. diplomats do not believe that brexit  which is distancing the uk from its normal european allies  affected the outcome. in 2017  15 countries including britain and the us voted to oppose a request for the icj ruling.", "uk suffers crushing defeat in un vote on chagos islands", "2019-05-22t17:56:03z", "chagos islands";"united nations";"uk news";"world news";"us news"

states has been that the us should first sort out its own affairs. while the total number of us citizens in detention remains unclear  the family of four represents a substantial number removed  which could increase pressure on other countries to repatriate their own citizens. the uk has said a “small number” of children have left syria in the last 12 months and returned to britain via third countries  but its officials were not involved in helping them leave syria. shamima begum  who left london aged 15 to join isis in 2015  was stripped of her uk citizenship in an effort to prevent her fromm returning to the country. she gave birth in a detention camp to a baby boy who was considered a british citizen. he died three weeks later of pneumonia. citing privacy concerns  the us state department would not directly address whether the us family had been removed. in response to a query  a spokesperson said: “we are aware of a small number of us citizens present in camps in north-east syria. american citizens’ services cases in syria are extremely complicated due to the lack of consular access to the facilities where they are. “we take seriously all legitimate claims of us citizenship  no matter where those claims are made  and work to verify and handle those claims on a case-by-case basis. the united states will continue to repatriate its citizens  as we have done in the past.” the collapse of isis has left a legal minefield for citizens who travelled to join the group  and created headaches for many governments who remain unwilling to send officials to rescue detainees and risk a backlash from the public. securing the return of wives and children of isis fighters has been seen as less complicated and more feasible  and the united nations has increasingly urged member states to do more  particularly for children. “the thousands of children of foreign fighters languishing in camps  detention centres or orphanages in syria  iraq and elsewhere are among the world’s most vulnerable children ” said henrietta fore  the executive director of the un children’s agency  unicef. “they live in appalling conditions amid constant threats to their health  safety and wellbeing. they have little family support. while most are stranded with their mothers or other caregivers  many are completely alone. “in syria alone  unicef estimates there are close to 29000 foreign children  most of them under the age of 12. some 20000 children are from iraq while more than 9000 are from around 60 other countries. an additional 1000 children of foreign fighters are believed to be in iraq.” unicef said it had so far helped with 270 child repatriations. “these children [in the camps] are doubly rejected – stigmatised by their communities and shunned by their governments ” said fore. “they face massive legal  logistical and political challenges in accessing basic services or returning to their countries of origin. all are victims of deeply tragic circumstances and egregious violations of their rights. they must be treated and cared for as children.” france  kosovo  sweden and germany have recently removed women and children from al-roj and al-hawl camps  where kurdish forces have struggled to contain a spillover of up to 132000 people from isis’s former territory. many of those countries have used the nearby iraqi-kurdish border to transfer their citizens out of syria  defying demands from damascus that any transfer must be coordinated with its officials. some senior diplomats fear detainee cases could be politicised and effectively pawned in return for concessions if their repatriation was managed through the syrian government. others are exploring options with the international committee of the red cross (icrc)  which maintains ties with damascus. these would probably involve women and children being transferred via the syrian capital. north-east syria has been largely under the control of us-backed kurds throughout much of the war against isis and the syrian government plays no role in administering the camps. it has often claimed that governments operating in the war-ravaged north-east impugn its sovereignty. last month australia’s prime minister  scott morrison  said canberra was exploring options with the icrc to remove children born to isis members. about 20 australians are believed to be in detention in syria  nearly half of them children. norway is also understood to be considering this route.", "us repatriates family from syrian detention camp for isis suspects",

new deal  financed by green investment bonds issued by the european investment bank (eib)  could transform the economy  creating sustainable  secure jobs  and help tackle the unfolding environmental crisis while uniting young and old  socialists  greens and liberals across the continent. “this is a great opportunity for progressives across europe to unite around a doable  radical but at the same

of its campaign for a green new deal for europe this month  hundreds of politicians  mep candidates and civil society leaders – including leading figures in the labour and green parties in the uk – had pledged their support. varoufakis said he had been working closely with the uk labour party  which has already committed to implementing a transformative “green industrial revolution”. the labour

of well-paid  secure jobs. the growing awareness of a climate crisis is reflected in a surge of support for the greens across europe  who are on course for their strongest showing to date in the european elections and could find themselves kingmakers in a newly fragmented eu parliament. varoufakis said he had been working on his plans since 2003  and the challenge now was to implement a coordinated  pan-european proposal that could be scaled up. “a green new deal for europe will slingshot us out of this morass of under-investment  unemployment  and climate destruction and toward a future of sustainable  shared prosperity ” he said. diem25 is urging people across the continent to vote for meps who are committed to a radical green new deal – especially in light of the threat posed by the resurgent populist right to action on the environment. under the diem25 proposals  5% of europe’s gdp would be invested in a green transition  financed via bonds issued by the eib. varoufakis said there was currently around €3tn “sloshing around” in the financial sector – held in bank accounts  being used by companies to buy back their own shares and in the insurance and derivatives sectors. he said the plan  which has already won the support of some bureaucrats  could be implemented “tomorrow without changing any of the existing european treaties”. “think of the gnd as a sponge that can soak up the excess liquidity in the financial sector that is currently doing a lot of damage ” he said. the momentum behind a green new deal follows protests by extinction rebellion and the school strikes movement  which have helped to push the climate crisis higher up the political agenda. varoufakis said the protests were inspirational and he called on politicians and voters to take their cue from the younger generation. “this election is not a beauty contest. the future of europe and the future of humanity rest on its outcome ” he said. “we stand with the climate strikers  because when the adults in the room fail to respond to the greatest threat that our species has ever faced  it is time for us to follow the children who have the courage to show the way.”",

the american people are with us.” the rally is one of scores being organized by the american civil liberties union  planned parenthood action fund and other civil rights groups  in what they are describing as a stop abortion bans day of action. one of the most powerful speeches of the day came from congresswoman ayanna pressley of massachusetts. “i am outraged because this is outrageous ” she said. “this nation was built on the backs and grown in the wombs of women and our rights are not up for debate.” among those in attendance outside the supreme court was kathy kleeman  66  from south brunswick  new jersey. she said: “for all women in this country  it’s essential we protect these rights. i remember before roe v wade and it wasn’t good: it was very spotty and dangerous for a lot of women  and we mustn’t go back to that.” she added: “right-wingers are in the ascendant. i don’t believe donald trump cares about the issue one way or another  but this is red meat for his supporters.” gillibrand  senator from new york  said trump is turning women into “second-class citizens” in america. “this is the beginning of president trump’s war on women. if he wants this war  he will have it and he will lose.” booker  senator from new jersey  said: “we must wake up more men to join this fight and it’s not because we have mothers and wives and daughters. but because this is an assault on human dignity  on freedom.” warning of the danger of apathy  booker added that current generation cannot rest on the laurels of what previous generations achieved for civil rights. “this is a day in america when we must understand there can be no neutrality … today is a day in our land when we see people trying to take us backwards  but we must go forwards.” ryan  congressman from ohio  acknowledged that he used to be “pro-life” but  having worked with politicians and advocacy groups  and heard the stories of women  he had changed his position. “i find it insulting that some white male legislator is going to accuse women of infanticide and not caring about these kids.” many of the restrictions are intended to draw legal challenges  which religious conservatives hope will lead the nation’s top court to overturn the 1973 roe v wade decision that established a woman’s right to make the choice on whether to terminate a pregnancy. other states  including ohio and georgia  have banned abortions absent a medical emergency after six weeks of pregnancy or after the fetus’s “heartbeat” can be detected  which can occur before a woman even realizes she is pregnant. at six weeks an embryo is neither a fetus nor has a recognizable heart. those laws are in defiance of the roe v wade ruling  which affords a woman the right to an abortion up to the moment the fetus would be viable outside the womb  which is usually placed at about seven months  or 28 weeks  but may occur earlier. several speakers in front of the supreme court argued that congress must take action to codify roe v wade into law. leaders of naral pro-choice america and planned parenthood also addressed the gathering. the bans have been championed by conservatives  many of them christian  who say fetuses should have rights comparable to those of infants and view abortion as tantamount to murder. the supreme court now has a 5-4 conservative majority following two judicial appointments by donald trump. civil rights groups are suing to overturn the bans as eroding a woman’s right to bodily autonomy and say they endanger women who seek riskier illegal or homespun means to terminate a pregnancy. on tuesday  nearly two dozen states and municipalities sued the federal government to stop a new rule letting health care clinicians object to providing abortions and other services that conflict with their moral or religious beliefs. the lawsuit filed in manhattan federal court asked a judge to block a rule by the department of health and human services that is scheduled to take effect in july. associated press and reuters contributed to this report", "abortion-rights activists rally across us against extreme new state bans", "2019-05-21t19:25:46z", "abortion";"democrats";"planned parenthood";"republicans";"us news";"women";"roe v wade"

"julian borger";"owen bowcott", "the uk and us are facing a diplomatic rout at the united nations on wednesday when the general assembly is expected to vote overwhelmingly to demand britain relinquish hold of one of the last vestiges of empire in the indian ocean. both countries have lobbied intensely at the un to avoid support for britain dropping to single figures among the un’s 193 member states on the issue of its continued possession of the chagos islands  known as the british indian ocean territory. the archipelago is the site of the us military base in diego garcia  used by bombers on long-range missions and  in the past  for rendition flights carrying terrorism suspects. the general assembly vote follows an advisory opinion issued by the international court of justice (icj) in february that uk should hand over control to mauritius  which claims sovereignty over the islands. london and washington are trying to persuade allies to at least abstain  so as to prevent support for mauritius reaching triple figures. the mauritian mission to the un believes it has reached that threshold  winning pledges of backing from more than 100 member states. such a lopsided defeat would also serve to underline british isolation in a battle that many un member states  particularly in africa  see as a last stand to preserve a relic of empire  and at a time at a time when its european union allies  dismayed by brexit  are no longer automatically offering support. it would also reflect the diminishing persuasive power of the us  which campaigned vigorously for the uk cause. last week it took the unusual step of hosting a reception for the uk  attended by more than 60 member states  to allow british and american diplomats to put their arguments directly. the mauritian ambassador to the un  jagdish koonjul  predicted that the lobbying effort would fall flat  and that much of europe would either abstain or vote with mauritius. “i expect a number of european countries to stand up for the rule of law and show they value and respect the institutions member states have themselves created ” koonjul said on monday evening. britain took possession of the chagos archipelago in 1814 and held on to the islands after mauritian independence in 1968  allegedly through coercive pressure on independence leaders. three years earlier the uk had secretly leased one of the islands  diego garcia  to the us to use as a military base. the people of the islands  the chagossians  were forcibly evicted and have been campaigning for their return for decades. the icj advisory opinion in february stated the decolonisation of mauritius was not lawfully completed because the islands were split off from the territory three years before independence  and declared “the uk is under an obligation to bring to an end its administration of the chagos archipelago as rapidly as possible”. the mauritian-drafted resolution that will be voted on at the general assembly on wednesday calls for the icj opinion to be upheld and for the uk to give up control within six months and cooperate in the resettlement of the chagossians and other mauritian nationals. it calls on un and its agencies “to recognise that the chagos archipelago forms an integral part of the territory of mauritius”. the uk has said it will not abide by the icj ruling  arguing that bilateral disputes should not be presented to the court without the consent of both parties. it also insists that the base at diego garcia serves as an essential hub for global stability  used in operations against terrorism. mauritius has offered a long-term lease on the base but the us and uk have rejected the offer  arguing it does not exclude a mauritian veto on future military operations and the leasing of outer atolls to other powers  in particular china. “this case represents a potentially dangerous precedent for all un member states  as it could normalise the practice of litigating bilateral disputes through un general assembly advisory opinion requests  even when a state directly involved has not consented to the jurisdiction of the icj ” the us mission said in a statement  which pointed to the “joint us-uk military base on diego garcia in the maintenance of regional and international peace and security”. successive  humiliating votes to refer the uk’s territorial claim to the icj and in 2017 to deny britain a judge on the court also reflect growing resentment of the uk’s permanent position on the security council. professor philippe sands qc  who represents mauritius at the icj in the hague said: “on the day the foreign secretary announces the appointment of a human rights ambassador  his department leads the charge at the un general assembly to oppose a resolution affirming the right of self-determination  ending british colonialism and upholding the icj and the rule of law. a sad day for an isolated  lawless  colonial britain.” richard gowan  the un director for the international crisis group  warned against interpreting wednesday’s vote as a sign of a general collapse in uk diplomatic influence. “on the whole uk diplomacy at the un has been quite good on a number of issues ” gowan said. “but the colonial legacy resonates so deeply at the general assembly  there is very little even the smartest us or uk diplomacy can do about it.” earlier this month the labour leader  jeremy corbyn  wrote to the prime minister  theresa may  condemning her decision to defy the ruling of the un’s principal court  which concluded that britain should hand back the chagos islands to mauritius. his letter accused her of disregarding international law and the right of exiled islanders to return to their homeland. the unusual intervention  suggesting that a future uk administration could switch policy  further undermines uk efforts to persuade its allies of the justice of its cause.", "chagos islands: isolated uk and us face thrashing in un vote on ownership",

"shaun walker", "a shadowy “deep state” secretly runs the country. a smart immigration policy is “blacks go back”. nazi germany wasn’t all bad. none of these statements would be out of place in the darker corners of far-right blogs anywhere in the world. but in estonia as of last month  they are among the views of government ministers. since emerging from the soviet shadow three decades ago  estonia has gained a reputation as a country with a savvy focus on e-government  a vibrant free media and broadly progressive politics. but as in many european countries  estonia’s far right has been edging upwards in the polls in recent years  and nobody was all that surprised when the nationalist ekre party won 19 out of 101 seats in parliamentary elections in march. the real shock came a few weeks later when the prime minister  jüri ratas  invited ekre to join a coalition government. ratas offered ekre five out of 15 ministerial positions as well as policy concessions including agreeing to hold a referendum on whether to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. the party’s father-and-son leaders  mart and martin helme  took the key posts of interior and finance minister respectively and celebrated by flashing a white-power symbol at their swearing-in ceremony. ekre’s transition from the noisy fringe to the heart of government represents a remarkable failure of mainstream politics. between them  two broadly centrist parties won a comfortable majority of seats in the march vote  and kaja kallas  the leader of the reform party which placed first  offered ratas and his centre party a coalition in which she would be prime minister and the two parties would share ministerial posts equally. instead  ignoring the offer and stark warnings from his allies in brussels not to negotiate with ekre  ratas arranged a conservative coalition including the far-right party  which has allowed him to stay on as prime minister. “he threw all his values down the drain just to remain pm ” said kallas  who had been on course to become estonia’s first female prime minister but instead remains in opposition. many liberals fear the climate has already started to change. vilja kiisler  a columnist at the newspaper postimees with two decades of journalistic experience  said her editor-in-chief called her into his office shortly after the coalition formed and told her a piece she had written about ekre was too aggressive and she should tone down her rhetoric. “i’ve always criticised the people in power and this had never happened before ” she said. rather than accept self-censorship  she decided to resign. “style and content are always connected and i meant every word  comma and full stop. if you can’t be sharp and clear in an opinion piece then what is the point?” kiisler said ekre media portals attacked her work and she received threats of violence and rape through email and facebook  which she has reported to the police. for a country whose media landscape was this year ranked the 11th most free in the world  the resignations of kiisler and a state radio journalist who left his job for similar reasons have come as a shock. they even prompted estonia’s president  kersti kaljulaid  to wear a sweater emblazoned with the words “speech is free” to the swearing-in of the new government. kaljulaid said she wore the sweater because of the climate of increasing verbal attacks on estonian journalists. “this can lead to self-censorship  in the sense that you don’t talk any more to avoid this kind of shitstorm  and i don’t want this to happen ” she told the guardian in an interview at tallinn’s presidential palace. kaljulaid nevertheless gave her approval to the new government  saying she had no formal veto power. “if i had thought that signing off on this list of ministers would be a greater danger than unleashing constitutional uncertainty  i could have considered it  but this is not the case ” she said. she did  however  walk out of the ceremony during the swearing in of an ekre politician  marti kuusik  as technology and foreign trade minister. kuusik  who faces a series of domestic violence allegations  resigned the next day. he has denied the allegations. mart helme criticised kaljulaid’s walkout as the action of “an emotionally heated woman”. kallas said: “they are setting an example that it’s ok to call names  to threaten violence. it has brought misogyny out of the closet and its a very bad sign for our society.” ekre has forged links with other far-right groups in europe joining the italian interior minister matteo salvini’s coalition of nationalists and welcoming france’s marine le pen to tallinn for discussions. like populist parties across europe  ekre has highlighted immigration as a key battleground issue. mass migration hardly seems a major concern for estonia  which has not been on any route to europe taken by refugees and migrants from the middle east and africa  but ekre has suggested that by allowing any migration at all  estonia will be vulnerable to future pressure from brussels to resettle many more refugees. jaak madison  an ekre mp who will also become an mep if the party clears the threshold at upcoming european elections  said the country could take “10 or 50” refugees  but with the proviso that “when the war is over they go home”. in an interview at his office inside the riigikogu  estonia’s parliament  madison described the white power signals from mart and martin helme as “pure trolling” that should not be taken seriously. he admitted there were “maybe a few people in the party who are really thinking this  white power and supremacy”  but he said people would only be kicked out of the party for extremist deeds  not extremist opinions. madison is considered the polished face of the party. when asked about a blogpost he wrote several years ago praising nazi economics  he did not disown the views. “the fact is that the economic situation raised. that’s a fact. how did it happen? it was very wrong things. if you’re pushing people to camps  it’s wrong. but the fact is that the unemployment rate was low ” he said. madison is not the only ekre mp to be curious about nazi economics. ruuben kaalep  the leader of ekre’s youth wing  blue awakening  said rightwing politicians “can’t completely disown” nazi germany  which had certain positive elements. kaalep is estonia’s youngest mp  aged 25  and in an interview at a chic restaurant not far from the parliament  he described his mission as fighting against “native replacement”  “the lgbt agenda” and “leftist global ideological hegemony”. the party has largely avoided baiting estonia’s russian-speaking minority  instead using historical sensitivities over soviet-era population transfers to exploit fears of a new  currently imaginary  wave of muslim migration. kaalep  however  said he did not believe that estonia’s russian-speakers could ever be considered estonian  even if they learned fluent estonian and identified as estonian citizens. the party has called for a quota system for passportisation of the community. some fear this kind of rhetoric could pave the way for russia to make more forceful attempts to “defend” ethnic russians in the country and provide grist to the kremlin’s propaganda mill. “russia has always tried to show estonia as a small nazi state  but it had no basis for it ” said kallas. “now they can use everything that the current government does against us.”", "racism  sexism  nazi economics: estonia's far right in power", "2019-05-21t04:00:30z", "estonia";"the far

"robert booth", "ethnic minorities in britain are facing rising and increasingly overt racism  with levels of discrimination and abuse continuing to grow in the wake of the brexit referendum  nationwide research reveals. seventy-one percent of people from ethnic minorities now report having faced racial discrimination  compared with 58% in january 2016  before the eu vote  according to polling data seen by the guardian. the data comes amid rising concern at the use of divisive rhetoric in public before this week’s european parliament elections  where some leading candidates  including ukip’s carl benjamin and the independent tommy robinson  have records of overt racism. the survey by opinium suggests racists are feeling increasingly confident in deploying overt abuse or discrimination. the proportion of people from an ethnic minority who said they had been targeted by a stranger rose from 64% in january 2016 to 76% in february this year  when the most recent polling was carried out of 1006 people weighted to be nationally representative. the trend appears in line with crime figures  which have shown that racially motivated hate crime has increased every year since 2013  doubling to 71251 incidents in england and wales in 2018  according to the home office. david lammy  the labour mp for tottenham and a leading anti-racism campaigner  described the findings as “alarming”  while omar khan  the chief executive of the runnymede trust  a race equality thinktank  said it was now clear that brexit  while not the source of racism  had led to higher levels of racism being expressed and that social media was “normalising hate and increasing division”. the poll comes amid a wave of headlines about racism in britain  from the bbc’s sacking of danny baker for tweeting a picture of a couple with a chimp following the birth of the duke and duchess of sussex’s baby  to growing anger from professional footballers at racism online and in stadiums. meanwhile  the conservatives and labour have been tainted by allegations of islamophobia and antisemitism respectively. the survey found that at the end of 2016  37% of people saw racism on social media on a day-to-day basis  but that has now risen to 50%  and is even higher for younger minority ethnic people aged 18 to 34. online racism has more than doubled since before the referendum  to 51%  and there were rises of about 50% in the number or people reporting hearing people ranting or making negative comments about immigration or making racist comments made to sound like jokes. people from a black background reported the greatest increase in discrimination  with the proportion saying they had been abused or discriminated against rising from 59% in january 2016 to 65% the following october and to 74% this february and march  when the latest poll was conducted. respondents from the east of england were most likely to say they had suffered racism. minority ethnic women also reported a sizeable increase  with 74% saying they had faced racial discrimination this year  compared with 61% in the latter half of 2016. this increase in racial discrimination is mainly down to racism from strangers. looking at the types of racial discrimination faced  the proportion saying they have experienced someone making a racist comment in jest has risen to over half (55%) of people from ethnic minorities. lammy said: “it is no coincidence that this rise has come as anti-migrant populists seek to divide the country using the playbook of donald trump. “this has both legitimated and encouraged abuse online and in the real world. i have experienced first-hand the rise in racist content on social media  and the level of abuse experienced by the younger generation makes dealing with this problem of paramount importance.” khan said: “the eu referendum has both revealed and amplified the experience of racism among ethnic minorities in britain. “even before the referendum a clear majority of britain’s 8 million ethnic minorities reported experiencing racism and being targeted with overt discrimination. following the referendum  these figures have now risen to around three in four ethnic minorities  meaning that millions of ethnic minorities have been targeted with overt racism.” he said the large rise in racism on social media raised concerns about whether online channels were normalising hate and increasing division. “rather than dismissing or ignoring the extent of racism  it’s important for politicians – as well as media and social media companies – to show leadership in challenging racism ” he said. “britain’s leaders must reflect on how they can ensure britain’s ethnic minorities feel safe and secure  and have equal opportunities and choices in where they work  commute and live.” there were small falls in the number of people who felt they were victims of more tacit forms of discrimination such as being treated with suspicion by police or security

on economic policy (france’s marine le pen is protectionist  fvd anything but); on foreign policy (many are pro-putin  many decidedly not); and on the lessons of brexit after the chaos of britain’s attempt to leave. almost alone among the eu’s rightwing populists  fvd  which until recently was calling unambiguously for nexit  or a dutch exit from the eu  still favours a referendum on membership (even though the dutch government abolished advisory referendums last year). of at least 15 parties demanding eu plebiscites in 2016  barely any are still doing so – and one that is  germany’s afd  has lost support. moreover  none of the three eurosceptic groups currently in parliament look likely survive the elections unscathed. fvd hopes to join the conservative ecr  which includes britain’s conservatives and poland’s ruling law and justice (pis) party. that group  however  will be weakened by the loss of the far-right danish people’s party and the finns party to salvini’s new nativist alliance  which held its first rally in milan on saturday and is expected to swallow the hardline enf group of le pen’s national rally and austria’s scandal-hit freedom party. the third group  efdd  home to afd and britain’s brexit party  also looks unlikely to survive. no one knows where the hungarian meps from orbán’s fidesz  suspended from the centre-right epp  will end up. “given these multiple divisions  the cohesiveness of eurosceptic parties as a collective force should not be overestimated ” the open europe thinktank concluded in a recent report. baudet and eppink’s dreams of a united front to roll back the eu may not become reality as readily as they hope.", "dutch eurosceptics dream of united front to roll back eu", "2019-05-20t13:40:49z", "european elections";"european union";"the far right";"netherlands";"europe";"world news"

on friday night  two german media outlets published a video that shows the austrian deputy chancellor and leader of the far-right freedom party (fpö)  heinz-christian strache  talking to an unidentified woman purporting to be the niece of a russian oligarch at a luxury resort in ibiza. when the woman expresses an interest in gaining control of the country’s largest-circulation tabloid  kronen zeitung  strache suggests he could offer lucrative public contracts in exchange for campaign support. strache and his parliamentary leader  johann gudenus  who had initiated the meeting  resigned on saturday  saying their behaviour was “stupid  irresponsible and a mistake”. shortly after their resignations  the chancellor  sebastian kurz  of the centre-right austrian people’s party (övp)  called snap elections  likely to be held in september. what do we know about the sting operation? it remains unclear who set up the carefully planned sting. though filmed in july 2017  the video was only leaked to journalists at der spiegel and süddeutsche zeitung last week. the publications say they will not comment on the origin of the video in order to protect their sources  but they commissioned a certified russian translator and it forensics experts to verify its authenticity before publishing. in his resignation statement on saturday  strache called the video “a honey trap stage-managed by intelligence agencies”  but also alluded to a controversial israeli spin doctor with links to austria’s centre-left social democratic party (spö)  and even the german satirist jan böhmermann  who had cryptically referred to “hanging out with fpö party colleagues at a russian oligarch’s villa on ibiza” in a broadcast in april. böhmermann’s manager has confirmed the comedian knew of the video’s existence. what is the fpö? founded by a former nazi functionary and ss member after the end of the second world war  the fpö became the first rightwing populist party since 1945 to form part of a government in europe when its late leader jörg haider entered a coalition with the conservative övp in 2000. the power-sharing deal was eventually mired in a series of corruption scandals – the fpö finance minister at the time is still on trial over charges of bribery and embezzlement in connection with the privatisation of the state housing company buwog. after strache  a hardliner  took over the fpö in 2005  he managed to rejuvenate the austrian far right largely by vowing to root out the “adventurers  profiteers and soldiers of fortune” in its ranks. the party entered a coalition government with the övp after finishing third in the 2017 general election. what role does russia play in austrian politics? austria has traditionally seen itself as a “bridge builder” between the east and the west and  even outside the far right  the country has a history of neutrality and relatively warm ties with moscow. under strache  however  the fpö took its pro-russian tendencies to new extremes  signing a formal cooperation agreement with vladimir putin’s united russia party. austria’s foreign minister  karin kneissl – appointed by the fpö – not only invited the russian president to her wedding  but danced with putin  sending out a message that critics say undermined the eu’s stance against russia over ukraine. with the fpö in charge of austria’s interior and defence ministries  western spy agencies including those of the uk have reportedly restricted the amount of intelligence they share with austria  fearing it may in turn be shared with russia. what are the implications for the european elections? centrist leaders across europe hope the fallout from the “ibiza scandal” will be felt beyond austria in the european parliament elections this week  in which populist  nationalist and far-right parties have been forecast to make gains. strache’s apparent eagerness to embrace corruption is in stark contrast to the “drain the swamp” rhetoric populists routinely deploy in their attempts to portray politics as a battle by decent ordinary people against a venal elite. the fpö is a key member of an alliance of european nationalist parties led by matteo salvini of italy’s league. what happens next? the austrian president  alexander van der bellen  has proposed the country hold elections in early september. with strache gone  it appears unlikely kurz can hold together his coalition government in the interim. opposition parties insist a full investigation into the scandal would only be possible if the fpö’s herbert kickl were to leave the interior ministry with immediate effect. kurz could decide to replace the far-right party’s ministers with technocrat placeholders until the vote  a move that has been supported by the spö.", "austria's 'ibiza scandal': what happened and why does it matter?", "2019-05-20t10:27:56z", "austria";"the far right";"europe";"world news";"european elections";"european parliamentary elections 2019"

a hurricane is a large rotating storm that forms over tropical or subtropical waters in the atlantic. these low pressure weather systems draw upon warm water and atmospheric moisture to fuel their strength and will gather pace if not slowed by patches of dry air  crosswinds or landfall. “they are very tall towers of winds that move at the same speed  sometimes 60000ft tall ” says jim kossin  a scientist at the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration. “if they are unmolested by wind shear or run over land they will continue on their merry way.” storms are given names once they have sustained winds of more than 39mph. hurricanes are gauged by something called the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale  which runs from one to five and measures speed. once a storm gets to category three it is classed as a major hurricane  with winds of at least 111mph and enough force to damage homes and snap trees. category five storms  of at least 157mph  can raze dwellings  cause widespread power outages and result in scores of deaths. this strongest class of hurricanes includes hurricane katrina  which caused the inundation of new orleans in 2005  and hurricane maria  which flattened much of puerto rico in 2017. how do they differ from typhoons and cyclones? both hurricanes and typhoons are tropical cyclones – the only difference is the location where they occur. in the atlantic  the term “hurricane” is used  while “typhoon” is used in the pacific. in the south pacific and indian ocean  the term “tropical cyclone” is often deployed. why is there a hurricane season? almost all hurricanes develop once the northern hemisphere approaches summer  with the hurricane season running from 1 june to 30 november. the season peaks between august and october. this is because wind shear  which can disrupt hurricanes  dies down during summer  while the temperature of the oceans rise and the amount of moisture in the atmosphere increases. these conditions are ideal for spawning hurricanes. the season isn’t strictly defined  however. “it can start earlier ” says jennifer collins  a hurricane expert at the university of south florida. “recall 2016  when hurricane alex (a storm that rattled bermuda) formed in january.” what has happened with hurricanes in recent years? it’s been a punishing past few years for people living in the path of hurricanes in the us and caribbean. last year there were an above-average 15 named storms  including hurricane florence  which brewed off the west african coast before barrelling into north carolina  plunging much of the state into darkness and dumping up to 76cm (30 inches) of rain in places  resulting in flooding that killed dozens of people. this was followed by hurricane michael  the first storm to make landfall in the us as a category five event since 1992. the 160mph storm obliterated the town of mexico beach in florida  caused more than 70 deaths and racked up an estimated $25bn (£19bn) in damage. these disasters came in the wake of the 2017 hurricane season  which caused a record $282bn in damage. hurricane harvey unloaded 33tn gallons of water on texas  the astonishingly strong hurricane irma  which reached a top speed of 177mph  ravaged florida and several thousand people died in puerto rico after hurricane maria  another category five storm  tore across the island. the misery in puerto rico  in particular  is ongoing  with the us government strongly criticised by local elected officials for a sluggish and insufficient response to the catastrophe. does this mean that hurricanes are getting stronger and more damaging? while the overall number of hurricanes has remained roughly the same in recent decades  there is evidence they are intensifying more quickly  resulting in a greater number of the most severe category four and five storms. the proportion of tropical storms that rapidly strengthen into powerful hurricanes has tripled over the past 30 years  according to recent research. a swift increase in pace over a 24-hour period makes hurricanes less predictable  despite improving hurricane forecasting systems  and more likely to cause widespread damage. the devastation unleashed by recent hurricanes has led to warnings that premiums may rise as insurers face ballooning claims. a record $135bn was paid out by insurers in north america in 2017  mostly as a result of hurricane damages. “we have a new normal ” says ernst rauch  a senior executive at insurance company munich re. “we must have on our radar the trend of new magnitudes.” is the climate emergency to blame? a range of factors influence the number of hurricanes smashing into land  from localised weather to periodic climatic events such as el niño. prior to 2017  the us had experienced a hurricane “drought” that had stretched back to hurricane wilma in 2005. but there is a growing evidence that the warming of the atmosphere and upper ocean  due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels  is making conditions ripe for fiercer  more destructive hurricanes. “the past few years have been highly unusual  such as irma staying strong for so long  or the hurricane in mozambique that dumped so much rain ” says kossin. “all of these things are linked to a warming atmosphere. if you warm things up  over time you will get stronger storms.” the climate emergency is tinkering with hurricanes in a variety of ways. more moisture in the air means more rain  while storms are intensifying more quickly but often stalling once they hit land  resulting in torrential downpours that cause horrendous flooding. rising sea levels are aiding storm surge whipped up by hurricanes – one study found that hurricane sandy in 2012 probably wouldn’t have inundated lower manhattan if it occurred a century previously because the sea was a foot lower then. according to the un’s intergovernmental panel on climate change  the maximum intensity of hurricanes will increase by about 5% this century. the expanding band of warmth around the planet’s tropical midriff also means a larger area for hurricanes to develop  resulting in fierce storms further north than before  such as florence. in the pacific  this change means typhoons’ focal point is switching from the philippines towards japan. researchers are currently attempting to ascertain if climatic changes will help bend the path of hurricanes enough that more will charge in the direction of the uk in the future. “this has implications for places that have historically been unaffected by tropical cyclones ” says collins  who added these newly-hit areas are likely to suffer a significantly higher risk of structural damage than traditional hurricane zones. “we are already seeing effects of climate change ” says collins. “while there is not consensus on the frequency of hurricanes in a warmer world  there is a consensus that the hurricanes are becoming more intense  and hence their impact will be worse.” are people adapting to these changes? the forecasting of hurricanes has become a fine art  with scientists able to predict with sharp accuracy the anticipated path and ferocity of hurricanes. in the us  affected states have refined systems for warnings and evacuations and have a hefty federal agency  fema  to plough billions of dollars into patching up shattered towns and lives. but planning is often haphazard  with flooded houses repeatedly rebuilt in the same locations despite the morphing risks posed by the climate crisis. the concreting of houston’s green spaces removed key sponges for harvey’s water  which sloshed into people’s homes. meanwhile  natural buffers to hurricanes  such as mangroves and coral reefs  are being stripped away around the world as a result of coastal development  pollution and warming waters. there are more people in harm’s way  too – in the south-eastern us  for example  coastal populations grew by more than 50% from 1980 to 2003. climate change adaptation rules have been scrapped by donald trump’s administration  making it easier to build critical infrastructure in risky coastal areas. “coastal towns and cities are not currently prepared for the changes already occurring and will continue to occur ” says collins. “we know that there are areas that are prone to flooding. we need to not rebuild on these areas  and build on higher ground. “those who deny scientific findings in favour of magical thinking and other such fallacies will only leave the world a more unstable and dangerous place for future generations to come.” the situation is even starker for poorer caribbean nations that will increasingly rely upon international help to deal with stronger hurricanes and rising sea levels. hurricane maria devastated the island of dominica  leaving just 5% of the country’s buildings intact. its prime minister  roosevelt skerrit  who lost his own roof in the storm  subsequently told the un that he had come “straight from the front line of the war on climate change”. “we as a country and as a region did not start this war against nature ” a visibly shaken skerrit says. “we did not provoke it. the war has come to us.” what next? researchers have been poring over ocean temperatures and other data to ascertain what’s in store for the 2019 hurricane season  which starts on 1 june. us officials will unveil their best guess on thursday in washington. meteorologists at colorado state university have predicted there will be a slightly below-average atlantic season of 13 named storms  five of which will become hurricanes. this prediction rests on the presence of a mild el nino – a natural climatic event that periodically warms the pacific ocean  a process that tends to suppress the development of atlantic hurricanes. there is still plenty of uncertainty in these early predictions. “early forecasts can be a but sketchy ” says kossin. “in general  it looks like it will be around average. but we will have to see.” further reading ninth ward jewell parker rhodes eye of the storm: a book about hurricanes rick thomas thirty-eight: the hurricane that transformed new england stephen long typhoon joseph conrad", "are hurricanes getting stronger – and is the climate crisis to blame?", "2019-05-20t06:00:25z", "hurricanes";"natural disasters and extreme weather";"world news";"us news";"climate change";"climate change";"environment";"science"

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/20/turkey-insists-on-right-to-drill-for-energy-reserves-off-cyprus", "helena smith", "tensions over energy resources in the eastern mediterranean have risen sharply after turkey said it would “exercise its sovereign rights” to drill off cyprus in flagrant defiance of warnings from western allies. as the dispute over potential gas reserves intensified  ankara insisted its state-of-the-art drilling ship  the fatih  and its support vessels would begin operations in waters viewed by the eu as being within the island’s exclusive economic zone. “turkey does not recognise the unilateral and illegitimate exclusive economic zone claims of the greek cypriots ” its foreign minister  mevlüt çavuşoğlu  announced in a letter released by the state-run anadolu news agency. “third parties should refrain in taking sides in overlapping maritime boundary claims and they should not act as if they are in a court in rendering judgement on bilateral maritime boundaries.” despite international condemnation  the ships  escorted by a naval frigate  have been deployed 39 nautical miles off the divided island’s western coast for the past week. the closest turkish shore lies almost 80 nautical miles away. but ankara  which refuses to recognise cyprus – instead acknowledging the self-proclaimed turkish republic in the north – argues the region is part of its own continental shelf and  as such  it is complying with international law. it is a stance that  increasingly  has put the nato country at odds with allies. on sunday a senior cypriot official said nicosia will issue international and european arrest warrants “for all involved” if  as looked likely  drilling did take place. earlier this month  the eu’s policy chief  federica mogherini  expressed “grave concern” over turkey’s intentions. in a statement that highlighted growing alarm at the sabre-rattling  she hinted that sanctions could follow if ankara did not heed the bloc’s warnings. “we urgently call on turkey to show restraint  respect the sovereign rights of cyprus in its exclusive economic zone [eez] and refrain from any such action to which the european union will respond appropriately and in full solidarity with cyprus.” the european council president  donald tusk  said brussels was closely monitoring the situation. “we stand united behind cyprus ” he said of the island  the eu’s most easterly member state. any exploration would not only escalate tensions dramatically but increase fears of a “hot incident” with repercussions across a region where the race to tap underwater spoils is becoming ever more intense. israel  egypt and lebanon  which have also discovered hydrocarbons off their coasts  have all signed delimitation agreements with cyprus. in recent years  international oil companies  including exxonmobil  total and eni  have acquired search rights in licensed blocks off the island. three months ago the us energy company announced it had found one of the biggest deposits of natural gas off the island  even if the offshore wealth was far from being commercially exploitable. ankara hit back  saying without a settlement to the island’s division  the internationally recognised greek cypriot administration was clearly bent on exploiting reserves at the expense of turkish cypriots. cyprus has been split along ethnic lines since 1974 when an attempt at union with greece prompted turkey to invade  resulting in its majority greek and minority turkish populations living either side of a un-patrolled ceasefire line. “the presence of international energy giants in our exclusive economic zone is the best vote of confidence for our actions ” the well-placed government source told the guardian. “by questioning the legitimate rights of cyprus in its continental shelf and eez  turkey is also questioning the agreements that we have already signed with neighbouring countries.” the escalating dispute comes less than a week after turkey launched its largest-ever naval exercise  operation seawolf  with more than 130 warships in the region. much of the naval deployment is set to occur in waters close to the island. “our aim … is to show that the turkish armed forces are extremely determined  committed and capable of ensuring the security  sovereignty  independence  maritime rights and benefits of turkey ” said the country’s defence minister  hulusi akar. last year  turkey dispatched gunboats to prevent drilling operations by eni  an italian energy company commissioned by the cypriot government  in what was seen as a brazen act of brinkmanship. the company abandoned the search. turkey’s moves are also causing mounting alarm in washington with the state department rebuking its key nato ally for action that it called “highly provocative”. cyprus  which lacks a navy  is not a member of the alliance but has launched a far-reaching diplomatic initiative to shore up solidarity among partners. stepping up those efforts  officials confirmed the president  nicos anastasiades  had sent a letter at the weekend to the british prime minister  theresa may  protesting about “unacceptable” comments that cast doubt over the island’s sovereignty of the area where turkey intends to push ahead with the drilling. the uk’s stance is at odds with every other eu member state  they said. anastasiades said he will raise the issue with michel barnier  the eu’s brexit negotiator  when he visits nicosia on monday.", "turkey insists on right to drill for energy reserves off cyprus", "2019-05-20t04:00:23z",

trump has issued one of his most direct threats yet to tehran  warning that “if iran wants to fight  that will be the official end of iran”. the us president emerged from his golf club in sterling  virginia  on sunday to tweet belligerently at around 4.30pm  thereby risking a quickening of tension that is already rising. “never threaten the united states again!” he wrote. the tweet will do little to assuage jitters in the middle east and in washington about aggressive language coming out of the white house. concern is already running high that trump’s hawkish national security adviser  john bolton  who played a key role in instigating the invasion of iraq under george bush  might be nudging the administration towards military action. in 2015  bolton wrote a new york times op-ed entitled “to stop iran’s bomb  bomb iran”. trump withdrew the us from the iran nuclear deal last year. on the other hand  trump has a way of blowing hot one minute and cold the next. as with so many of his social media missives  the precise import of his sunday tweet was hard to read. it directly conflicted with reports of just three days ago that the president had been telling the pentagon he did not want to go to war and wanted to find a way to wind down tensions. those reports were also subject to qualification. in response to reports about a draft plan for the deployment of 120000 troops  trump said that though he did not want war  if it came to it he would send “a hell of a lot” more soldiers than that. earlier on sunday  the utah senator and former republican presidential candidate mitt romney had joined the commander of the iranian revolutionary guards in dismissing the threat of war. “going to war with iran?” romney asked on cnn’s state of the union. “not going to happen.” according to the fars news agency  maj general hossein salami followed foreign minister mohammad javad zarif by saying iran was not pursuing war either. but both men offered caveats. romney  a member of the senate foreign relations committee  said the threat to us interests was “real” and added: “we’re going to make sure they understand that if they take action against our people  against our allies and against our friends  there will be consequence and it will be far more severe than the initial action taken by iran.” salami said iran was ready to fight  as the difference “between us and them is that they are afraid of war and don’t have the will for it”. the white house has not said what is behind its claim of an increased threat. romney said the “intelligence community says there’s a great deal of risk” but did not elaborate. it has been reported that us intelligence believes iranian commercial vessels have carried missiles and ammunition  which some analysts say indicates preparations to defend against a us attack. saudi arabia is the major us ally in the region. four oil tankers  two of them saudi  were attacked off the coast of the united arab emirates. iran-allied rebels in yemen claimed a drone attack on a saudi oil pipeline. adel al-jubeir  saudi arabia’s foreign minister  told reporters on sunday his country also “does not want war … but at the same time  if the other side chooses war  the kingdom will fight this with all force and determination”. the us has sent an aircraft carrier strike group and cautionary moves include an evacuation of personnel by the oil firm exxonmobil and a warning from the us to commercial air traffic of increased risk in the region. the associated press reported on sunday that democrats in congress will be briefed by former cia director john brennan  a stringent trump critic  and wendy sherman  a former state department official who helped negotiate the iran deal. among democratic presidential hopefuls on sunday  the presumption was that trump either wanted war or was behaving irresponsibly. the hawaii congresswoman tulsi gabbard  a military veteran  told abc’s this week trump was “leading us down this dangerous path towards a war in iran”. seth moulton of massachusetts  another veteran  said war with iran would be “exactly what john bolton wants”. but david petraeus  a retired general who led us troops in iraq in 2003 and later led the cia  told abc it was “pretty clear” trump “doesn’t want to go to war with iran. he’s not after regime change”. romney agreed. “i don’t believe for a minute ” he said  “that either the president or john bolton or anyone else in a serious senior position of leadership in the white house has any interest in going to the middle east and going to war. that’s just not going to happen … barring some kind of attack from iran or something of that nature which i don’t think anyone anticipates. “look  the president made it very clear that he thinks the greatest foreign policy mistake probably in the modern age was the decision by president bush to go into iraq. the idea that he would follow that by going after iran  a more difficult enemy if you will  that’s just not going to happen.” famously  trump said at the time that he supported george w bush’s invasion of iraq. he has since vehemently denied that he did so.", "trump tweets threat: 'if iran wants to

 was shared thousands of times on social media by yemenis and the diaspora community keen to draw attention to their country’s rich history and cultural contributions to the world. “[the collection is] designed to humanise what has quite obviously become a dehumanised war ” she said. “beyond the headlines and death tolls  humans have bore the brunt of this unnecessary and devastating war.” the sun rose and pushed them one by one onto the ageing bus fresh bread  a little butter and some cheese that’s all it took - oh and some tea a whole lot of singing and laughter; that’s a perfect day at the beach untitled poem from ‘war &amp; love’ by sana uqba ibrahim’s team at the ramooz foundation is planning to nurture new literary talent in sana’a with a new project called kitabat  hosting a creative writing workshop in sana’a in the summer and crowdsourcing funds for a writer in residence programme in the city. “i feel lucky to witness the artistic energy in yemen at the moment ” ibrahim said. “it’s such an active scene in literature  visual arts  filmmaking. it deserves support. “there’s a social responsibility to avoid the destruction of our culture and heritage and seeing how these young artists grow more confident in their talents when they get to share their work is amazing.” this article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. what else should we cover?

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/19/german-art-collective-generate-electricity-art-e-werk-luckenwalde", "kate connolly", "when the luckenwalde coal power plant in east germany closed down soon after the collapse of communism  the locals were both relieved and concerned. “finally people could hang out their laundry without it getting covered in soot ” said bernd schmidl  one of the plant’s senior employees. worries about jobs were soon allayed when the workers were given better-paid employment elsewhere  he said. but fears remained that the listed building  with elements of art deco and art nouveau  would fall into disrepair. “who was going to find a long-term use for an old building spanning 10000 metres over four floors?” now  almost 30 years since it ceased operating as a power station  the plant  30 miles south of berlin  is to be reactivated. but instead of powering local industry as it did for almost 80 years  it will fuel the contemporary art centre housed within it. e-werk luckenwalde will offer exhibitions  a residential programme  workshops and studio space for artists  who increasingly are being squeezed out of berlin by its lack of affordable space. it will open to the public on 14 september with power night  a performance and music festival run by block universe. pablo wendel  38  is the brains behind performance electrics  a not-for-profit art collective that bought the plant in 2017. e-werk is his most ambitious project yet to involve the production of electricity through artworks or artistic methods  patented as kunststrom (art electricity). in recent years wendel has produced electricity from wind sculptures developed out of recycled street reflection posts and from guerrilla-style appropriations of electricity supply points using mobile battery packs. his first successful production of kunststrom was in 2008  and involved him tapping into the light of advertising hoardings  attaching solar modules to them and using the resulting energy to feed art gallery lightbulbs. his clients include three public galleries and 23 private households in germany. profit created from the production of kunststrom is invested directly back into performance electrics. on a tour of the plant  wendel  who trained at the royal college of art in london  described the intricate process of renovating the plant and familiarising himself with every pipe  valve  piston and pressure meter. “it’s like bringing a dinosaur back to life ” he said. instead of environmentally unfriendly brown coal  e-werk will be powered by spruce pine woodchips provided by the leftovers from the production of wooden cable drums in a neighbouring factory. the resulting charcoal will be used as a soil nutrient as part of e-werk’s ambition to be carbon neutral  and the heated waste water will eventually go into on-site coffee roasting and beer brewing facilities. “we’ll turn a quarter of the station on in september  starting with 40 kilowatts an hour (enough to power 200 homes) then gradually increase production ” wendel said. artists from berlin were knocking on the door as soon as they heard there were large spaces to rent at affordable prices just 30 minutes by train from berlin. within a few months a choreographer  a painter  a musician  a film-maker  a drawer and a sculptor had moved into studio spaces on the third and fourth floors. helen turner  e-werk’s joint artistic director  who previously worked as a senior curator at cass sculptor foundation in chichester  uk  said involving local people had been a vital part of the process. “this is their history and we’ve been really grateful that many of them have wanted be part of it  offering us vital technical advice as well as regaling us with their accounts of what it was like to work here  and bringing us relics from the factory ” she said. wendel is used to deploying subversive techniques  having squatted in a fish and chip shop for his ma show  knocking down a wall between it and the adjoining rca  as well as inserting himself among the terracotta warrior ranks. performance electrics already powers a sculpture park in katzow  northern germany  through wind sculptures  as well as a section of the state gallery in saarbrücken  and has a 20-metre (65ft) pylon in stuttgart that powers its own headquarters and almost two dozen individual households. luckenwalder residents are putting their faith in e-werk’s ambitions. the town’s population has decreased by about 6000 since the fall of the wall  largely owing to economic emigration. the town boasts 150 listed buildings  but many – such as the striking former hat factory designed in expressionist style by erich mendelsohn – lie empty  owned by speculators hoping for a boom time but not otherwise much interested in the economic wellbeing of the town. “they [wendel and turner] are lateral thinkers  and we need a few more of those around here ” said schmidl  who came forward to offer advice after reading an appeal in the local paper for historical eyewitnesses. he pointed to the bright blue stained glass window pane over the entrance way  which depicts a left fist clutching a spray of electricity bolts  and said it symbolised the collective power of the workforce. now it has become e-werk’s logo and embodies the political message wendel would like to convey. “we were so fed up about the economic model we were forced to live in as artists. we want to establish an alternative ” wendel said. “we would like to insert artists in industry rather than being at the whim of the commercial art market. “it’s an act of subversion every time we bring art into the national grid. a homeopathic dose  but it’s a start.”", "'art electricity' revives old german power station",

42024, "world 2019 may 19 dalai-lama-cautious-india-vetoed-china-meeting-2104-xi-jinping", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/19/dalai-lama-cautious-india-vetoed-china-meeting-2104-xi-jinping", "michael safi";"lily kuo", "china’s president xi jinping agreed to meet the dalai lama during a state visit to india in 2014  but the plan was quashed by delhi  the buddhist spiritual leader has said. the bombshell claim  which could signal that in the early years of his term xi was open to the most radical shift in china’s tibet policy in decades  was made during an interview for a book by indian journalist sonia singh  an executive at the delhi-based television channel ndtv. the dalai lama appeared to let the detail slip casually in the november 2018 interview  according to an audio recording the observer has heard. “i have a brief meeting with prime minister narendra modi  [and] when xi jinping came to delhi  i also wanted a meeting with him ” he said. “so i already have some connection  some contact directly through my friend. so xi jinping agreed  but the indian government … was a little cautious.” “that would have been a landmark meeting if it had happened ” singh replied. the dalai lama appears to agree before the talking moves on. the stray remark might have been attributed to a misunderstanding or the use of imprecise language by the dalai lama  83  who speaks english fluently but with a heavy accent. but singh says she sent the transcript of the interview to his office for approval  and received no objections. nor has tibet’s government-in-exile  based in the indian himalayan city of dharamshala  issued a denial or any other comment since singh’s book  defining india: through their eyes  was released in delhi last week. china’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement sent to the guardian that the claim was “sheer nonsense”. “with regards to the 14th dalai lama  our policy has been consistent and clear ” the statement said. the 14th incarnation  born tenzin gyatso  has lived in india since fleeing the province in 1959 after a failed uprising. the dalai lama does not advocate independence for tibet but more autonomy for the region. yet successive chinese leaders have portrayed him as a dangerous “splittist” and “wolf in monk’s robes”  and sought to prop up alternative buddhist leaders. the officially atheist chinese communist party says it has the right to approve his successor. china claims it “liberated” the far west region in 1950  overturning feudal practices and bringing the remote region into the modern era. activists and rights advocates say tibetans face cultural and religious repression – as beijing has launched a harsh  years-long campaign to stifle dissent  namely self-immolations by protesting buddhist monks. beijing says tibetans are free to practise their own religion and culture. the dalai lama’s exile in india has been a persistent source of discord – and  for delhi  leverage – in the relations between asia’s two rising powers. “if it’s correct  it’s a very major development ” said robbie barnett  former director of the modern tibetan studies programme at columbia university. “i’ve never seen any suggestion of a [chinese official] meeting with the dalai lama  let alone at this level. “it would completely overturn [beijing’s] standard working method for dealing with tibet  which since 1994 has been to insult the dalai lama literally at every opportunity  while also holding talks with his representatives  which have also mainly turned into attacking the dalai lama.” a handful of academics and policy advisers had written articles after xi came to power in 2012 urging a relaxing of the hardline tibet policy of his predecessor  hu jintao  barnett added. “but we never saw any sign or rumour that they were successful. this is the only indication that there might have been a possibility of a major rethink.” amitabh mathur  a high-ranking former indian intelligence official who served as an adviser to the government on tibetan affairs between 2015 and 2018  said he had heard that the dalai lama had wanted a meeting with xi during his first visit to india five years ago  but was not aware if the offer had been accepted or if india had scuttled it. delhi would have had reason to object to the meeting  he added. “i think it is a bit much to ask of the indian government  which had recently been elected and had the chinese premier visiting for the first time ” mathur said. “it is a bit much to ask to take the focus away completely from what was a bilateral visit.” rather than signalling a shift in policy  agreeing to the meeting may have been part of a long-term chinese campaign to exploit points of tension in the relationship between delhi and the tibetan leader  he said. they might have accepted the invitation knowing india would be likely to veto it. “the chinese would certainly like to drive a wedge between his holiness and the government of india ” said mathur. the narendra modi government in its first years was seen to be willing to risk chinese opprobrium by playing the “tibet card”  said manoj joshi  a fellow at the delhi-based observer research foundation. modi invited senior tibetan leaders to his inauguration and sent ministers to receive the dalai lama at events. however  the situation had changed by the time the dalai lama gave his interview last year  amid a push by indian diplomats to improve relations with beijing. senior indian officials have been asked to keep their distance from events surrounding the 60th anniversary of tibet’s abortive uprising against chinese rule this year. “a certain coolness has crept in ” joshi said. barnett said that in revealing the meeting plans  it was possible the dalai lama had been sending a message to those in his movement who dismissed his strategy of trying to engage with xi’s administration. equally  the spiritual leader may have just unintentionally said too much. since 2014  china under xi has maintained its repressive policies towards tibet. in a white paper released in march 2019  the government excluded a reference found in earlier policy documents to being open to engaging with the dalai lama. the fact the dalai lama’s office allowed the release of the information also suggested the window for meeting had closed  said barnett. “it does suggest they’ve given up any hope that it could happen again.” for xi  who launched his belt and road initiative in late 2013  agreeing to such a meeting could have had diplomatic benefits. “the main thing the chinese would gain from it is soft power from the world because the dalai lama is seen as a person of peace and the world sees china as oppressing people ” said adrian zenz  who focuses on ethnic policies in china  in tibet and xinjiang. although india hosts the dalai lama  it has not been outspoken about oppression in india. last year  authorities banned tibetans from marking the 60th anniversary of the failed uprising against chinese rule. “they don’t want to rock the boat ” he

henley";"philip oltermann", "austria is heading for snap elections after the far-right vice-chancellor resigned over a video that appeared to show him promising public contracts to a woman posing as a russian backer  in return for help in his election campaign. the austrian chancellor  sebastian kurz  said on saturday that “enough was enough” and his conservative austrian people’s party (övp) was ending its 18-month-old coalition with the nationalist freedom party (fpo). elections would be held “as soon as possible”  kurz said. kurz’s deputy  fpo leader heinz-christian strache  earlier told a press conference he had been the victim of a “targeted political assassination” aimed at breaking apart the coalition government  and insisted he had done nothing illegal. however  strache admitted the secretly filmed footage showed him “acting like a teenager” and that his behaviour had been “stupid  irresponsible and a mistake”. fighting back tears as he asked for forgiveness  he said that in the cold light of day  his remarks were clearly “catastrophic and exceedingly embarrassing”. kurz  who has repeatedly been forced to distance himself from the fpo after a string of recent revelations about extremist  antisemitic and racist sympathies in the far-right party  said that while he had not always commented publicly there had been “many situations where i had a lot of trouble tolerating the fpo’s behaviour.” in meetings on saturday with the fpo  he said  he “had not felt a readiness to change”. since it was not possible to continue with the far-right party or form a new administration with the opposition social democrats  who reject his tax and debt-cutting agenda  he said  “i have informed the president of my wish to hold national elections.” the german weekly der spiegel and the daily süddeutsche zeitung published the video on their websites on friday. the papers said the recordings took place in a luxury ibiza villa in july 2017  months before the parliamentary elections that brought kurz’s conservative and strache’s far-right parties to power. the recordings show strache  who took over as leader of the nationalist party in 2005  and the fpo’s parliamentary leader johann gudenus  who also resigned on saturday  talking to an unidentified woman purporting to be the niece of a russian oligarch about how she could invest in austria. the woman says she is interested in gaining control of the country’s largest-circulation tabloid  the kronen zeitung  to which strache replies that after staff changes at the paper  it could help the fpo in its election campaign. strache is also filmed saying the woman would then be able to gain access to public contracts. both newspapers said they had no clear information about who had set up the elaborate sting operation  but the video had been authenticated by experts. the vice-chancellor’s apparent eagerness to accept russian help raises further questions about the extent of the fpo’s longstanding ties to russia. the far-right party has signed a formal cooperation agreement with president vladimir putin’s united russia party. germany’s chancellor  angela merkel  said on saturday that the continent was “confronted with currents  who want to destroy the europe of our values”. far-right parties rejected values like the protection of minorities and basic human rights  merkel said  and “politicians being for sale also plays a role”. strache  49  who will be replaced as party leader by his deputy  the transport minister  norbert hofer  apologised for flirting with the woman  whom he describes as attractive in the recording. “it was typical alcohol-fuelled macho behaviour in which  yes  i also wanted to impress the attractive female host ” he said. calling for early elections  the social democrats described the incident as austria’s biggest postwar scandal. hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside kurz’s office  chanting “snap elections now!” and “sebastian  your government  your responsibility”. the fpo’s lead candidate in next week’s european parliament elections  harald vilimsky  cancelled a trip to milan planned for saturday  where he was due to take part in a campaign event launching an alliance of european far-right parties led by the italian interior minister  matteo salvini. the far-right party’s co-chair  christian hafenecker  said lawyers were considering the party’s response. neither strache nor the party received any benefits from the persons concerned  he said in a statement  adding that since the video was “obviously recorded illegally  we are also preparing appropriate legal steps”. in the video  strache  whose party’s first leader was a former ss officer  also ponders the part-privatisation of austria’s public broadcaster  saying it should be more like the government-mouthpiece state media has become in neighbouring hungary. he also appeared to suggest political donations might be made through a foundation with links to the fpo  rather than the party itself  apparently in order to escape legal scrutiny. kurz’s options are limited because while his övp tops opinion polls  it is well short of a majority in parliament. the only other party with which it could hope to form a majority government is the social democrat party  with which the chancellor has strained relations.", "austria to move fast to hold elections after

42027, "world 2019 may 18 hungary-crucible-facebook-attempt-banish-fake-news", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/18/hungary-crucible-facebook-attempt-banish-fake-news", "emma graham-harrison";"shaun walker", "the denunciation filled the front page of one of hungary’s main newspapers. “facebook has become a political actor ” declared the pro-government magyar nemzet  the latest attack in an escalating campaign against the social media giant. in hungary  facebook’s attempts to clean up its platform and salvage its reputation are increasingly bringing it into confrontation with the government. the resulting showdown highlights worrying flaws in the systems that the us company has created to stamp out fake news  hate speech  bot armies and other “bad actors”. the immediate target of the newspaper’s ire was facebook’s new controls on political advertising  rolled out after the cambridge analytica scandal spurred worries about “dark ads” online. because the rules cover promotion of any political content  news articles are caught up in the dragnet  and paid promotion automatically banned. “they allow users to issue death threats against [viktor] orbán  but we can’t advertise the sports daily ” the paper fumed. in the us and western europe  facebook has protected the ability of major media to advertise their content by creating a “whitelist” of reputable news organisations. but the rest of europe has not been covered  and so no news outlets can promote any content. it is just one way that hungary and other small countries appear to be treated as second-tier nations by a company uncertain how to handle political  legal and commercial minefields. for months  facebook’s top executives have paraded their new systems of control around the world  insisting they are apolitical. yet efforts to tackle abuse are premised on a functioning democracy  with legal checks and balances  a free press and a vibrant civil society. the company has sidestepped the question of what to do in places without those institutions  arguably the very places most vulnerable to propaganda and manipulation. hungary is proving to be a crucible  where facebook’s ability to police its network is being tested. this year the nation slipped down freedom house’s global rankings of liberty and democracy  to become the only “partly free” country in the european union. the institutions that facebook relies on to police content elsewhere  from campaign groups to a free media  are being undermined  shut down or forced out. among the most direct impacts  facebook does not have a fact-checking partner in hungary. no organisations met its standards  a spokesman said  so the company has simply fallen back on tools it admits are insufficient. the lack of checks means fake content festers online on prominent pages. a video investigated by independent magazine hvg  which was posted by origo  one of the country’s biggest news websites  showed a woman being mugged in a church  with a soundtrack of shouting in arabic. blazoned across the screen was “europe  2017”. the video actually showed a 2015 attack inside a us cathedral; both attackers were american. more than a year later it is still on facebook. nor has facebook laid out any guidelines for how it plans to balance its commitment to political neutrality with its promise to clean up the platform in cases when a government  its allies or opposition are behind fake news  hate speech and other bad behaviour  a dilemma the company has already faced in hungary. last year the company took down a video of a senior hungarian politician blaming crime on immigrants  for violating the platform’s rules  but the next day restored it. “exceptions are sometimes made if content is newsworthy or important to the public interest ” facebook said. this muddled approach appears to satisfy neither the government nor its critics. facing increased scrutiny from facebook  as more and more content is reported as inappropriate and removed  the orbán government has moved on to the offensive. századvég  a government-connected thinktank  published a long report on facebook last month complaining that the company’s “principles of political correctness” mean that more and more hungarian politicians and public figures have become “victims of censorship”. content has been deleted or accounts suspended  especially for sharing posts linking immigrants to terrorism or crime  a staple of the hungarian pro-government media narrative. the thinktank commissioned a poll it said showed that 79% of hungarians found it unacceptable for a social media site to “delete content based on its own political views”. most ominously  the report came up with a serious of recommendations for governments to tackle facebook’s supposed bias including “harsher legal steps against whoever wants to inhibit freedom of speech and freedom of opinion”. while there are few specific details  it reads like the ground is being prepared for a legal campaign against facebook by the government. peter kreko  a political analyst  says the government is smarting from the advertising ban  as it relied on media allies to bolster its message  and may well see if it can move against the us firm. “i think they won’t be shy about trying to limit the operations of facebook if they don’t feel its a useful tool for them any more for campaigning ” said kreko  who works at the thinktank political capital. “on the one hand  [this ban] is really hurting them. they have used facebook so far as an important tool in the campaign system. on the other hand they are happy to use this opportunity to present themselves as victims.” jános lászló runs an ngo that funds print it yourself  a campaign distributing samizdat leaflets in the hungarian provinces in a bid to counter government control of information. he said simply posting information on facebook was pointless  as most people do not go to the site for news. they can only be targeted by paid content that will appear on their facebook feed. “for us  as a small ngo  it’s too expensive  so we use printed materials instead ” he said. pro-government media accounts have been able to use their advertising to parachute stories into the feeds of those people who do not follow media outlets online and whose friends may not normally share political content. hvg found a disturbing pattern of facebook use from several pro-government news outlets ahead of elections last year. perhaps most egregious was the facebook page of tv2  which posted no videos in the months before and after the election  but more than 120 in the month voters went to the polls. the page went from no views to 13 million views almost overnight. there were similar spikes from no videos or views to more than 5 million views on the website origo. the videos were posted more than a year ago  and brought to facebook’s attention more than a month ago  but the company said it had not had time to investigate. nor are the problems faced by hungary like to stay inside its borders. while most videos uncovered by hvg were probably aimed at hungarians  not all controversial content made there has been. last year the government’s official account posted a video – in english and with an american accent – attacking guy verhofstadt  chief brexit representative for the european parliament. it included fake content  using a photo from 2014 to purportedly illustrate events after 2015  and took verhofstadt’s comments out of context. facebook refused to take it down  even after verhofstadt complained. but the choice of language indicated that its main audience was probably outside hungary. “social media fake news does not stay within the border’s of a country that produces it ” said andrea chalupa  a writer and expert in disinformation. she added: “this is another urgent reason why countries like hungary and russia  which attack and undermine journalists and watchdogs  require well-funded and effective fact-checking safeguards from facebook. it’s a matter of public safety and security.”", "hungary: the crucible for

not the guns and knives of the notorious drug gangs who held medellín in their clutches for decades  but art and culture. today carvalho  now a medellín councillor  is turning his attention to another city – one that is no stranger to art or culture but which has suburbs that are afflicted by crime and exclusion among their disaffected youth: paris. in a meeting with city officials last week  carvalho explained how young people in medellín had been persuaded to use their talents to turn their city around. “thirty years ago  medellín was the most violent  the most dangerous city in the world. nobody wanted to go there  not even colombians ” carvalho told the observer. “today the city attracts tourists and colombians. “we discovered you can really change people’s lives with culture. not by giving them culture  but by getting them involved in it. we don’t stage a concert  we give people the tools to stage their own.” growing up in medellín  which spent two decades under the yoke of the largest cocaine cartel in history run by the notorious drug lord pablo escobar  carvalho has described comuna 13 as a terrifying place. “there were murders all the time. the police didn’t come here  they just couldn’t … it started to change when we opened the doors to community participation and artists started to understand they have a role in the city ” he told a television documentary. among the projects carvalho oversaw was allowing graffiti artists to decorate the 385 metres of covered escalators  part of a regeneration programme giving comuna 13 residents easier access to their hillside homes. “today local youngsters do graffiti tours. they not only have a fierce pride in their district  but it enables them to earn money. before they were condemned to be at the service of the drug lords  because there was nothing else for them to do. now there is. the change is enormous ” he said. medellín’s youth are also being given access to music lessons and instruments and encouraged to set up hip-hop “schools” where the older ones teach their juniors  he said. “at first the idea was that if they had an instrument in their hands they wouldn’t be holding a gun  but we’ve discovered so much talent. now they play music instead of sitting at home drinking  smoking or taking drugs.” the paris meeting was organised by ruth mackenzie  artistic director of the châtelet theatre and a passionate advocate of culture for all. british-born mackenzie has been making waves at the historic châtelet  previously known as broadway-sur-seine for its penchant for american musicals  which opens in september after a two-year renovation with what she describes as “activist” ambitions. one of its first shows will be a rap music adaptation of albert camus’ les justes – a play set in moscow about a socialist revolutionary plot to murder a despotic governor – by the french rapper and director abd al malik  who has been writing the script with youngsters from some of paris’s poorest areas. in the suburb of aulnay-sous-bois  where a series of national riots started in 2005 highlighting social tensions in the french banlieues  other youngsters are learning circus skills for another châtelet show. mackenzie and carvalho say paris is not medellín  but lessons can be learned. “we know from experience that the arts can help those in prison  in social services  in the prevention of radicalisation  and communities dealing with vandalism and crime ” mackenzie said. the paris deputy mayor responsible for culture policy  christophe girard  who has met carvalho  agreed. “daniel is extremely interesting  articulate and profound ” girard told the observer. “his presentation was formidable. “we should definitely have links between our cities and joint projects. we know how important art and culture are; every single time we open a cultural place in a district where there isn’t one  it completely changes that district. it enables people to meet  to talk  to sing  dance … to dream.” mackenzie says what impressed officials most was when carvalho revealed a graph showing how since engaging local communities  murder rates in medellín had plummeted to a low of 496 in 2015 (though last year the number rose 7.6% to 626 homicides  many in comuna 13). “our artists aren’t police officers and we’re not going to work miracles  plus paris is not medellín  but the values we’re instilling through the arts  like respect  engagement  listening to others are really important ” mackenzie said. “i watch these kids learning circus tricks and they may not end up working as acrobats  in fact they probably won’t  but they are learning important life skills that will help them … plus it’s fun.”", "hip-hop schools and graffiti art saved medellin. can they do the same for paris?", "2019-05-18t13:30:00z", "paris";"cities";"theatre";"culture";"colombia";"americas";"young people";"world news"

they are simply pro-control. while #youknowme is powerful  it’s also profoundly depressing. women shouldn’t have to publicly defend their humanity. they shouldn’t have to justify wanting bodily autonomy. they shouldn’t have to broadcast their personal stories in order to remind legislators that they’re not just baby-carrying vessels; they are human beings. ‘break the girls’ women were at the forefront of the mass protests that recently ended omar al-bashir’s decades-long rule over sudan  accounting for 70% of demonstrators according to some estimates. cnn has a chilling piece on how the bashir regime tried to use rape to silence these women. “break the girls  because if you break the girls  you break the men ” soldiers were told. the women did not break. more male managers afraid of interacting with women #metoo has made men afraid of interacting with women at work  according to new research by leanin.org and surveymonkey. sixty percent of male managers said they were uncomfortable mentoring  socializing  and having one-on-one meetings with women  up 14% from last year. almost half of male managers said they were uncomfortable socializing with female colleagues outside the office  and more than a third actively took steps to avoid such interactions. 33 women now lead fortune 500 companies that’s up from 32 in 2017 and 24 in 2018. while the figure is a record high  it’s pretty dismal that only 6.6% of fortune 500 ceos are women. drinking and dehumanization new research published in the journal sex roles has found that women drinking alcohol are viewed as “less human” and more sexually available. it’s a troubling reminder of the double standards around drinking  and the way in which alcohol is used to blame women for sexual assault  and exonerate men. lesbian batwoman to the rescue it’s been a pretty depressing week  so i think we could all do with some sapphic superhero news. cw has unveiled the first trailer for its new batwoman series  starring ruby rose. an openly lgbt actor playing an openly gay superhero is a tv first  and a small sign of progress. dogs are a woman’s best friend according to a new study  dogs are more likely to obey women than men. this is apparently because women are more empathetic. i have no idea how scientifically sound this research is  but i think we can all agree that dogs are very good boys.", "women shouldn't have to tell abortion stories to remind lawmakers they're human", "2019-05-18t12:00:36z", "abortion";"activism";"feminism";"alcohol";"women";"dogs";"society"

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/18/israeli-firm-nso-group-linked-to-whatsapp-spyware-attack-faces-lawsuit", "dan sabbagh", "the israeli firm linked to this week’s whatsapp hack is facing a lawsuit backed by amnesty international  which says it fears its staff may be under surveillance from spyware installed via the messaging service. the human rights group’s concerns are detailed in a lawsuit filed in israel by about 50 members and supporters of amnesty international israel and others from the human rights community. it has called on the country’s ministry of defence to ban the export of nso’s pegasus software  which can covertly take control of a mobile phone  copy its data and turn on the microphone for surveillance. an affidavit from amnesty is at the heart of the case  and concludes that “staff of amnesty international have an ongoing and well-founded fear they may continue to be targeted and ultimately surveilled” after a hacking attempt last year. nso group  founded in 2010  supplies industry-leading surveillance software to governments that it says is for tackling terrorism and serious crime  and has been licensed to dozens of countries including saudi arabia  mexico  bahrain and the uae. but there have been a string of complaints in the past few months  documented largely by the toronto-based citizen lab  that the technology has been used to target human rights groups  activists and journalists by several countries – and that there has been no attempt to rein it in. that culminated  earlier this week  in the announcement by facebook-owned whatsapp that it had raced to patch up a security hole in its messaging service  which it believed had been exploited by nso group  that would have allowed spyware to be placed on a person’s mobile phone simply via a missed whatsapp call. that represents a technical step beyond the breaches reported by amnesty in its lawsuit  although it is not the first time that nso has been accused of exploiting whatsapp to hack phones. last june  an amnesty staffer received “a suspicious message over whatsapp”  according to the affidavit. the recipient was asked to cover the protest “for your brothers detained in saudi arabia in front of the saudi embassy in washington” and invited to click a link. technical analysis indicated the link was part of “a network of digital infrastructure comprising more than 600 suspicious domains used to lure targeted individuals to click on links that trigger infection with pegasus spyware” onto a target’s mobile phone  it said. such links often aim to impersonate news sites by using slightly misspelled domain names or different suffixes  for example replacing .com with .net. the israeli government’s defence export controls agency has failed to exercise proper oversight “despite serious allegations of abuse”  the affidavit claimed  adding: “because of deca’s inaction  nso group can continue to sell its software to governments known to target human rights defenders.” it is the latest in a string of israeli lawsuits faced by the company. omar abdulaziz  a saudi dissident based in montreal  last december filed a lawsuit in israel in which he claimed that nso software had been used to target his phone at a time when he was in regular contact with the journalist jamal khashoggi. in october  khashoggi is believed to have been killed and dismembered at the saudi consulate in istanbul  turkey – although the middle eastern country’s government still denies involvement. saudi arabia is understood to have licensed nso technology in 2017  paying $55m for the technology  according to israeli news reports. nso said it wants to “do whatever is necessary” to ensure its technology is used for fighting terrorism and serious crime and “not abused in a manner that undermines other equally fundamental human rights”. its response came in a 26-page reply sent earlier this week to amnesty and citizen lab from the british venture capital firm that is now its parent company. three months ago  a majority stake in nso was acquired by the london based firm novalpina capital  founded by the banker and philanthropist stephen peel. it appears eager to rehabilitate the controversial software company’s reputation and maintain its value. the lengthy reply to amnesty  signed by peel  claimed that in “almost all” the cases of complaints of human rights abuse raised  the alleged victim of hacking had not been a target or the government in question had acted with “due lawful authority”. a statement that has been challenged by amnesty. danna ingleton  the deputy director of amnesty’s technology division  said: “we believe that the reality is different. we’ve seen them target human rights organisations and no evidence they’ve been able to effectively control governments when complaints have been raised.” profile: stephen peel peel  a former olympic rower who competed in the seoul olympics  is a long-term financier who set up novalpina in 2016 after stints at the investment bank goldman sachs and the us private equity giant tpg. in recent years he has become a philanthropist as well  sitting on a number of boards  and said last year he had donated £100000 to the anti-brexit campaign group best for britain. “we have heard the strident calls from those against us to try and close down debate and silence discussion over the disaster that brexit appears to be. i for one  will not be silenced ” he said in an interview with the observer. however  peel stood down from the board of global witness  a human rights and environmental campaigning organisation in february  after the buyout of nso. the statement announcing peel’s departure described his decision as “typically selfless” – although there is understood to have been considerable concern in some quarters of the organisation once the acquisition was confirmed.", "israeli firm linked to whatsapp spyware attack faces lawsuit", "2019-05-18t05:00:29z",

"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/18/bleach-miracle-cure-uganda-us-pastor-robert-baldwin-sam-little", "ed pilkington";"alon mwesigwa", "an american pastor from new jersey backed by a british former clairvoyant is running a network that gives up to 50000 ugandans a “miracle cure” made from industrial bleach  claiming drinking the toxic fluid eradicates cancer  hiv aids  malaria and most other diseases. the network  led by pastor robert baldwin and part-funded by sam little from arlesey in bedfordshire  is one of the most extensive efforts yet to distribute the “miracle cure” known as mms  or “miracle mineral solution”. the guardian has learned that poor ugandans  including infants as young as 14 months old  are being given chlorine dioxide  a product that has no known health benefit and can be extremely dangerous. baldwin  52  is importing bulk shipments of the components of mms  sodium chlorite and citric acid  into uganda from china. the two chemicals are mixed to produce chlorine dioxide  a powerful bleach used in the textile industry. the american pastor has “trained” about 1200 clerics in uganda on administering the “miracle cure” and each in turn uses it to treat about 50 congregants  usually after sunday service. as an inducement  baldwin is offering smartphones to those clerics who are especially “committed” to spreading the bleach cure. baldwin operates under a ministry he founded called global healing. the “church” advertises itself as “using the power of almighty god … to greatly reduce the loss of life” in africa. yet in a phone conversation with fiona o’leary  a campaigner against quack medicine who spoke to him while posing as a freelance journalist  baldwin said he distributed the bleach through churches to “stay under the radar”. “we don’t want to draw any attention ” he said during the call  a recording of which has been heard by the guardian. “when you draw attention to mms you run the risk of getting in trouble with the government or drug companies. you have to do it low key. that’s why i set it up through the church.” he added that as a further precaution he uses euphemisms on facebook  where he raises money through online donations. “i don’t call it mms  i call it ‘healing water’  to protect myself. they are very sophisticated. facebook has algorithms that can recognize ‘mms’.” baldwin  who trained as a student nurse and is understood to have no other medical expertise  said he chose uganda because it was a poor country with weak regulation. speaking from new jersey  where he is based  he told o’leary: “america and europe have much stricter laws so you are not as free to treat people because it is so controlled by the fda. that’s why i work in developing countries.” he added: “those people in poor countries they don’t have the options that we have in the richer countries – they are much more open to receiving the blessings that god has given them.” asked how babies and children were treated with mms  he said the dose was reduced by half. “little tiny infants can take a small amount  they will spit it out. it causes no harm – they just get diarrhea.” the guardian contacted baldwin by phone in new jersey and asked the pastor to explain his work in uganda. he said: “we use natural healing therapies to help people – that’s something christians do.” then he said: “i don’t think it’s a good idea to be talking to the media right now.” asked what doses of bleach he was using in africa  he abruptly ended the call. ‘sam’s orphanage’ mms is banned in several countries  including canada and ireland. in the uk and us it is strictly controlled and has led to fraud prosecutions. the us food and drug administration (fda) has issued a public warning that advises anyone with mms to “stop using it immediately and throw it away”. several people have been sickened by the chemical  the fda says  suffering nausea  diarrhea and potentially “life-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration”. baldwin’s growing mms network in uganda appears to involve the distribution of the bleach free of charge. it is not clear how the money is raised to pay for it. there are fundraising pages on facebook  though the sums of money donated seem small. the mms push has been partly bankrolled by sam little. aged 25  the briton is currently based in fort portal  in the west of uganda  where the guardian spoke to him via cellphone. according to his facebook page  little attended staffordshire university before setting up as a clairvoyant with a business that is now defunct called psychic sam. facebook posts from 2015 show him offering tarot card readings  “healings” and “regression therapy” for £6.99 ($8.90). he told the guardian he also made money through “investments” and was using his savings to help fund mms distribution in uganda with a donation of $10000. separately  he has also put $30000 into building a home for about 20 homeless ugandan children. he calls the home “sam’s orphanage” on facebook  where he is attempting to raise money through donations to complete the building. he said that project was a separate venture from his work with the bleach treatment and he insisted he had no intention of treating the children in his orphanage with mms. little was first introduced to the “miracle cure” in england by a friend. “somebody in my family was cured of cancer with mms ” he said. “i started researching online and saw more and more videos of people being cured. that’s when i decided to test it myself on malaria and travelled to africa.” little has posted a video online of a trip he made on 11 march to a village hospital in kyenjojo district  in western uganda  where he conducted a trial that he said would prove malaria could be cured with chlorine dioxide within two hours. though he has no medical training  the briton is seen on the video instructing workers in a tiny local hospital to administer the bleach according to the formula: 18 drops for adults  12 drops for children aged five to 12 and eight drops for children aged one to four. the video shows nine people being given two doses of the fluid  including a baby aged about 14 months who screams in his mother’s arms as he imbibes it. little claims blood tests conducted by a lab technician showed microscopic signs of malaria disappearing within two hours. the briton told the guardian a lab technician had looked at blood samples from the nine local people being tested and said they had been cured. little himself has not been back to the hospital to verify the results. he told the guardian he was repeating the study on hiv aids patients in several locations in uganda  to prove that mms was also a cure for that disease. he admitted he would not be allowed to conduct such “field studies” in the uk or us  but when asked whether he was using poor ugandans as guinea pigs he replied he was not doing any of this for money but purely out of altruistic motives. “it’s not using people as guinea pigs for trials ” he said  “it’s helping them. we’ve cured loads of people not just for malaria  cancer  hiv  all sorts of things.” asked to cite any scientific evidence that mms cured diseases  he pointed to a 2018 study in which chlorine dioxide was tested on 500 malarial patients in cameroon. the lead author of the study was enno freye of the heinrich heine university in düsseldorf  germany. the guardian contacted the university and was told its medical faculty had reviewed the study and found it “scientifically worthless  contradictory and in part ethically problematic”. in february  freye was stripped of his title of apl-professor of the faculty on grounds that he had “severely damaged the respectability and trust this title requires”. he no longer works at any institution of the university. the guardian attempted to contact freye for comment but did not immediately hear back. the uganda ministry of health was alarmed to hear about the mms trials  saying it had no information about chlorine dioxide being tested in ugandan hospitals. emmanuel ainebyoona  a spokesman for the ministry  said a government investigation had been initiated. “we are investigating these people’s activities. in the medical profession  you don’t do advertising when you heal people ” he said  referring to little’s video in which he claims to have cured malaria in two hours. the ugandan ministry of gender and social development  which vets and approves all new orphanages  said it was also launching an inquiry into little’s plans for a home for 20 children. “we have never received documents from fort portal showing the need for an orphanage ” a senior official said. “that is new information to us.”", "us pastor runs network giving 50000

"alabama’s move to outlaw nearly all abortions has reverberated across america  teeing up fresh debate in culture wars that have raged for decades. conservatives are looking to the judiciary for victories on social issues. the alabama ban laid bare a republican push to persuade the supreme court to overturn roe v wade  the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion. “this is the endgame of many years chipping away at our freedoms ” said jess mcintosh  a democratic strategist who was an aide to hillary clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. “they’ve waited for the moment they believed the courts would overturn precedent and go against the overwhelming will of the people. “apparently they believe that moment is now.” the near-total abortion ban signed into law on wednesday by the alabama governor  kay ivey  makes performing an abortion a felony in all cases  with no exceptions for victims of rape and incest. signing the bill  ivey said: “to the bill’s many supporters  this legislation stands as a powerful testament to alabamians’ deeply held belief that every life is precious and that every life is a sacred gift from god.” the move came on the heels of a highly restrictive bill in georgia  which makes performing an abortion illegal once a heartbeat is detected. similar legislation has passed in mississippi  kentucky and ohio. the latest efforts will almost certainly be blocked by the courts. conservatives say that’s the point. an appeal could take the matter all the way to the supreme court  where rulings have generational effects. as donald trump has added two justices  social conservatives think the odds are in their favor. ”in years past there was almost a feeling of what’s the point of taking risks on the state level and pushing legislation while knowing that if it went to the supreme court  the makeup of the court wouldn’t hear the case and would not overturn roe v wade ” said alice stewart  a republican strategist who advised the texas senator ted cruz in his 2016 presidential campaign. “that’s not the case any more. people feel emboldened given the fact that we have justices like brett kavanaugh and neil gorsuch who  in many minds  are a lot more ready and willing to consider overturning roe v wade than another makeup of the supreme court.” although the public remains somewhat split on abortion  recent polling has shown a majority supports abortion rights and opposes efforts to overturn roe v wade. highly restrictive bans  such as those in alabama and georgia  are even at odds with some republicans. a 2018 gallup survey found 77% of americans believed in exceptions for victims of rape and incest. the televangelist pat robertson  a longtime opponent of abortion  said alabama’s ban was “ill-considered”. “i think alabama has gone too far ” robertson told viewers on the christian broadcasting network. “it’s an extreme law. “they want to challenge roe v wade  but my humble view is that this is not the case that we want to bring to the supreme court because i think this will lose.” legal analysts also believe alabama may have gone too far. brian fitzpatrick  a professor of law at vanderbilt university  said the law was “not going to go anywhere”. “i see it being challenged ” he said  “i see the lower courts all striking it down  and i see the supreme court choosing not to take the appeal.” fitzpatrick did not doubt that the conservative-leaning court wants to chip away at roe v wade. but he expressed confidence that the justices would not want to face the consequences of doing away with the law entirely. “they don’t want to do a wholesale undoing ” he said  “because it’s too much of a political hot potato.” it was only four years ago that the supreme court declared same-sex marriage the law of the land  a historic moment made possible by the swing vote of former justice anthony kennedy. by the time the court reached its decision  public opinion had swung heavily in favor. social conservatives had lost the battle. so they shifted focus  toward religious freedom legislation that questioned the limits of lgbt rights. that paved the way for cases like masterpiece cakeshop  which involved a baker who refused to serve a same-sex couple. in a narrow ruling last year  the supreme court punted  leaving unresolved whether the baker could deny providing a wedding cake to a same-sex couple. among social conservatives  many see the path to policy running not through congress but the judiciary. despite their grievances with trump in 2016  many republicans repeatedly emphasized that electing him would ensure conservative dominance over judicial nominations. the strategy paid off. trump has filled judicial vacancies at a record pace. the majority of judges installed oppose abortion and lgbt rights. fitzpatrick said it was clear neither party was interested in appealing to the average american voter. “trump is kind of exhibit a that you should stop caring about the
